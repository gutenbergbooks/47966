<h2>Frank Armstrong at College.</h2>


<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER I.</span> <span class="subtit">THE FRESHMAN RUSH.</span></h2>

<p>It was the evening of a day in late September
and a noticeable chill in the air hinted at the
near approach of fall. Through the whole of
that day and for several days previous to the
opening of our story, incoming trains had deposited
their burden of enthusiastic young humanity
in the old town of New Haven.</p>

<p>From mountain, shore, city, town and country
came the throng of students like an army of
youth, to take up the work of the college year
at Yale, which opened her doors to them on the
morrow. Men from all classes were in that motley
throng which surged and billowed around the
corner of College and Chapel streets, for this
night was the night of "the rush," which tradition
says shall be the first event of the college
year. There were Seniors, in their new-found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
dignity of seniority; Juniors, nearer by a year
to the coveted goal of a degree; Sophomores, who
by the passage of time coupled with an adequate
stand escaped from the ignominious position of
the youngest class, and last, but not least, the
Freshmen who, to-night, began their existence as
a class. But the Freshmen kept themselves aloof
from the upper class-men, perhaps for reasons of
offense and defense for they were to be tried out
later on, and did not want to be found lacking.</p>

<p>Bronzed giants whose bulk proclaimed them to
be at least "football material" shouldered their
way through the crowd and the air was filled with
the chatter and hum of many voices. Greetings
between men who had been separated for the
summer were heard on every side.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dick. Mighty glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"Glad to see you again. It's great to be back,
eh?" and the speakers, with a hearty hand-grip
would pass on and repeat the formulæ with little
variation, to other friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly the blare of a brass band cut through
the chatter. Marshals sprang to the work of getting
the parade in order, for a parade always
precedes and has come to be part of "the rush."
These men, conspicuous by their long-handled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
kerosene torches and the 'Varsity Y emblazoned
on sweaters (for only men who have won the
coveted letter are eligible for the position of
marshals,) began to separate the groups.</p>

<p>"Seniors, this way!" was the shout.</p>

<p>"Juniors, this way!"</p>

<p>"Sophomores, this way!" And, quickly following
the command, the various groups, in the order
named, dropped into line and, led by the marshals
with torches swinging, went dancing down
Chapel street to the compelling melody of a
popular college marching song.</p>

<p>"Freshmen, this way!" And to the shout,
which was caught up and echoed up and down
the line, the new-comers to the halls of Yale
dropped in behind the Sophomores, feeling themselves,
for the first time, a class instead of merely
a huddled group without a bond of any kind.
Dancing as merrily as their predecessors to the
strains of the band, the Freshmen went swinging
down the street imitating to the best of their
ability the zigzag sweep of their elders. Hands
of strangers touched for the first time and arms
were thrown over strange shoulders and the
feeling was good.</p>

<p>In the middle of that swaying mass of Freshmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
it does not take long to discover our three
friends, Frank Armstrong, Jimmy Turner and
last but not least the irrepressible Codfish, clad
immaculately as usual. To-night he wore a
delicate gray Norfolk suit with a vivid blue tie
and socks to match, a tribute to the colors of
the college he had adopted.</p>

<p>"You are a brave one to appear in that Paris
model," laughed Frank, who had arrayed himself
in the oldest clothes he could find in anticipation
of rough times before the evening was
over.</p>

<p>"Merely trying to uphold the reputation of
the class and inject a little beauty into the occasion,"
returned the Codfish. "Look at our friend
James. He has the ear-marks of a hobo!"</p>

<p>Jimmy was far from being a beauty, it is
true.</p>

<p>"Safe and sane, sonny. Safe because the attentive
Sophomores won't take a second look at
me and sane because I need my good ones when
I go calling," retorted Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I think this Sophomore scare is pure bunkum,"
the Codfish suggested. "A fellow told me
to-night that hazing at Yale has been given up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Someone was hurt a while ago in the merry
pranks and the Faculty stopped it, eh?"</p>

<p>He wasn't quite certain about it, and wanted
verification.</p>

<p>"You're safe," said Jimmy, "they never trouble
the lady members of a class. Hello, what's
the matter?" he went on as the parade came to
a sudden halt at the corner of Church and Chapel
streets.</p>

<p>"Scrap, I guess," said Frank. "Bunch of
town fellows trying to muss up the leaders. Always
do that, they say. There they go across
the street, and here we go!" as the band, which
had stopped for a moment while a gang of young
rowdies tried to cut the line of parade and were
worsted in the attempt, began again and the
merry zigzag went on.</p>

<p>Around the central Green or square of the
city tramped the jolly hundreds, occasionally
giving voice to the chorus of a song the band
was playing or a cheer in which the Freshmen
joined as well as they were able, but in spite of
their desire to be real Yale men, stumbling badly
on the nine "Yales" at the end.</p>

<p>Up Elm street, lined with hundreds of townsfolk
glad to see the college once again in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
swing, their faces lit up by the red fire and
Roman candles in the hands of the marchers,
swung the leaders. At High street the procession
turned and entered the Campus. The gang
of town boys and young men which had trailed
the procession tried to force themselves into line,
but were summarily thrown out, and without
further molestation the marchers circled the
Campus or college yard, and, opposite the Library,
finally halted at a spot of green sward
previously selected for the wrestling.</p>

<p>The instant the leaders stopped there was a
grand rush of the hundreds behind to gain a
vantage point, and in a second the little circle
the leaders had formed was squeezed together
like paper.</p>

<p>"Get back, get back," yelled the torch bearers,
and emphasized their commands by pushing the
lighted torches under the noses of those composing
the living wall. Of course, there was
only one thing to do and that was to go back
with all haste. Pushing the ever-widening circle
of spectators back with threatening fury, the
marshals made a circle of sufficient capacity to
carry on the wrestling bouts, which were the
climax of "the rush."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Down!" howled the chief marshal, at which
the front rank of that squeezed and straining
wall squatted on the ground, but so great was the
pressure of the hundreds behind that a score of
the second row were shot clear over the heads
of the first row and into the ring.</p>

<p>"Out with the intruders," yelled a marshal,
and the unfortunates were seized and thrown
bodily into outer darkness over the heads of the
first rows and were lost to view in the ruck.</p>

<p>"Now I know why it is a good thing to put
on your old duds," Frank gasped to Turner as
they bored their way toward the center of activity.
Our three friends had left the ranks of
their class with many others when the head of
the parade reached the Campus, and dashed over
to a point where they were told the wrestling
usually took place, on a chance that it would be in
that spot this time.</p>

<p>Their guess was right and for a moment they
were actually within the coveted circle, but when
the marshals made their onslaught on the crowd
in order to expand the ring they were whirled
into outer ranks and had only, after a desperate
effort and "under a pressure of a hundred
pounds to the square inch" as Turner expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
it, succeeded in digging their way back to the
third or fourth tier in that circle of human faces.
They were more fortunate than the hundreds
who prowled around outside without a chance
of a glimpse at the wrestling.</p>

<p>"We've lost the Codfish," exclaimed Frank.
"Oh, Gleason," he called, but there was no answering
voice.</p>

<p>"Lost in the shuffle," said Turner. "He was
with us a minute ago but he'll turn up. He
won't miss any tricks, don't you forget it."</p>

<p>"He isn't much for this kind of a scramble
game," returned Frank. "I thought he was
holding back a bit when we struck in this last
time, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sophomores, bring out your candidates,"
roared a big man who wore the football Y on his
blue sweater.</p>

<p>"Who is that whale of a man?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"That's Howard, the football captain," volunteered
a boy just in front of them, who had overheard
the question. The speaker held a notebook
in his hand and they afterward learned he
was a news-heeler getting a story for the <em>News</em>,
the official college paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Freshmen?" inquired the heeler, looking our
friends over.</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"That fellow, yelling for a Freshman lightweight
candidate, is the crew captain," went on
the heeler; "and over there to his left is Dunnelly,
the chap who kicked the goal against
Princeton last year and saved us the game."
The heeler pointed out the celebrities as they
prowled around the ring, calling loudly for
wrestling champions.</p>

<p>"You see," explained the heeler, "there are
wrestling bouts in the three weights,&mdash;light,
middle and heavy, between the Sophomore and
Freshmen for the class championship. Three
bouts in each event."</p>

<p>"O, you Freshmen, show your sand, trot out
a candidate!" bawled one of the men within the
ring. The crowd outside clamored for candidates
from the Freshmen.</p>

<p>"We want a Sophomore lightweight!" roared
another, and the crowd took up the cry and repeated
it. "Sophomore lightweight, Freshman
lightweight, don't be quitters, come across with
the champions!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sophomore lightweight, Sophomore lightweight!"</p>

<p>"Freshman lightweight!"</p>

<p>"Don't be quitters!"</p>

<p>"Show your sand, Freshmen!"</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a commotion on one side
of the ring, and amid yells and the shaking of
torches, the living wall opened and a slender,
blond-haired youth stepped into the ring.</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Sophomore or Freshman?"</p>

<p>"Sophomore," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Your name," demanded a marshal.</p>

<p>"Ballard."</p>

<p>"Your weight?"</p>

<p>"One twenty-nine, stripped."</p>

<p>"You'll do."</p>

<p>Immediately two Juniors volunteered to second
him, and fell to work stripping him to the
waist, the traditional custom for the friendly
combat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the calling for a Freshman lightweight
went on without success, and the crowd
was throwing red-hot taunts at the youngest
class for shirking their duty. The Freshmen had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
pushed one of their number into the ring, but
he proved to be over the required weight and
was cast out without ceremony.</p>

<p>A commotion on the outside of the ring started
anew the calls for a Freshman lightweight, and
the call was unexpectedly answered by the appearance
of a young man in delicate light gray
clothes with blue necktie and socks to match,
who was passed unceremoniously over the hands
of the crowd and deposited right-side-up on the
green grass of the enclosure.</p>

<p>Jimmy gasped. "The Codfish, or I'm a Hottentot!"</p>

<p>"No one else, for sure. How did they get
him?" exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>The Codfish was greeted by a rattling cheer,
followed by much advice.</p>

<p>"Well done, Freshman!"</p>

<p>"Take off those pretty clothes!"</p>

<p>"He certainly is a Yale man, look at that tie!"</p>

<p>"Good work, Freshman, eat him up!"</p>

<p>The referee, the Captain of the Yale Wrestling
Team, strode over to the Codfish, and
looked him up and down.</p>

<p>"You are not a very promising specimen," he
said. "Ever wrestle before?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never," said Gleason. "All I know about
wrestling wouldn't hurt anyone."</p>

<p>"What's your name and weight?"</p>

<p>"Gleason, and I weigh one twenty-five."</p>

<p>"Stripped or with those clothes on?"</p>

<p>"Clothes and all," said the Codfish with a
grin, and his eyes wandering around the sea of
faces, chanced to light on his two friends, Armstrong
and Turner. He waved an airy salute
to them, and began with his seconds, two Seniors,
to divest himself of his coat, shirt and undershirt.</p>

<p>"He really means to wrestle," gasped Frank.
"Can you beat it?"</p>

<p>"He certainly has his nerve with him," returned
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"His middle name is nerve."</p>

<p>The preliminaries over, Ballard and the Codfish
faced each other in the flickering light of
the torches, shook hands, and at the shrill scream
of the referee's whistle, rushed at each other.
Neither was versed in the art of wrestling, but
both were about the same size. Down they went
on the ground, Gleason underneath, the Sophomore
struggling to pin the shoulders of the
Freshman to the ground, which meant victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
But just at the moment when things looked bad
for the under-dog, he slipped out of the hold,
squirmed free and threw himself with all his
force against the Sophomore, bearing him over
sideways. The assault was so sudden that Ballard
was taken unawares, and before he could
gather himself, Gleason sprang on the prostrate
boy and shoved his shoulder points on the grass.
A resounding slap on the back by the referee testified
to the success of the attack, and it was the
Freshmen's turn to cheer, which they did right
lustily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II. <span class="subtit">A BRUSH WITH THE POLICE.</span></h2>

<p>"First blood for the Freshman. Wow!!"</p>

<p>Both principals were now in their corners being
fanned with towels and put in shape for the
second bout which was to follow immediately,
for there were three in each event as the Codfish
learned to his sorrow. His eyes wandered
again to where Frank and Turner were wedged
in the crowd, almost speechless at what they
saw before them.</p>

<p>"The Codfish of all creatures in the world
to be wrestling for his class," laughed Jimmy.</p>

<p>"We live and learn. He may be out for football
yet."</p>

<p>The subject under discussion just at this moment
bent his head and whispered something to
one of his seconds, then looked up and nodded
in the direction of his friends agape on the other
side of the circle. For a moment the gaze of the
second rested on Armstrong and Turner. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the whistle blew and the boys sprang again to the
center of the ring.</p>

<p>This time it was different. The Sophomore
did not rush in so fearlessly. He circled round
and round with arms outstretched and figure
crouching. Then he sprang at the Freshman's
leg and before the latter knew it he was on his
back with his opponent squarely across his chest.</p>

<p>"Fall for the Sophomore," announced the
referee, slapping the victor on the shoulder.
Sophomore yells rent the air.</p>

<p>"A tie, a tie! Now bury the Freshman this
time. Go to it."</p>

<p>Again the seconds ministered to their men,
and after a two-minutes' rest the boys went at
it, but the Codfish, who was not noted for his
physical prowess, went down after a brief tussle,
and the lightweight event was awarded to the
Sophomores amid yells by that class which
echoed back from the buildings of the quadrangle.
Gleason struggled into his clothes, and
ducked through the living wall as fast as he
could go, while the calls for the middleweight
wrestlers were being yelled by the marshals.</p>

<p>A husky young Sophomore quickly responded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
but again the Freshmen were slow with their
man.</p>

<p>The big football captain, who had been in conference
with some of his aides, walked across the
ring.</p>

<p>"You red-head, there," pointing to Turner,
"come out here and defend the honor of your
class. The Freshman who just wrestled says
you're a good one."</p>

<p>Frank and Jimmy looked at each other.</p>

<p>"So that's the game the Codfish put up on
me," said Jimmy. "Wait till I get at him. I'll
dirty his clothes worse than they are now."</p>

<p>"Come on, Freshman," said the Captain peremptorily.</p>

<p>"I can't wrestle," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Get out here and learn then. Come on," and
the Captain reached a big hand over the heads
of the squatters in the ring. Jimmy felt compelling
hands pushing from behind, and with the
eyes of everyone on him, there was nothing to do
but go forward. A path was cleared for him
and he stepped into the ring.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Red. You've got to even this
thing up."</p>

<p>"Show us you have the goods!" yelled someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
whose sympathies were with the Freshmen.</p>

<p>The Freshman and Sophomore took their corners
after the referee had satisfied himself that
the pair would be well matched as to weight,
and soon they were down to wrestling condition
with bare backs and sock feet, because a wrestler
is never allowed to wear anything that might in
any way injure his opponent.</p>

<p>"Does your friend know anything about the
game?" inquired the news-heeler of Frank.</p>

<p>"Not much, he did a little of it at school, but
he is very strong," was Frank's reply.</p>

<p>"Well, he'll need it. That fellow who is pitted
against him is Francis who won the lightweight
event for his class last year, and is one of the
best men in his class at the wrestling game."</p>

<p>When the Sophomore got to his feet, it was
seen that he was a head taller than his opponent,
but not so heavily built. His slender body was
finely muscled, and his face wore a smile of confidence
which said quite plainly what his opinion
was of the outcome.</p>

<p>"Middleweights&mdash;Sophomore Francis, weight
148; Freshman Turner, weight 154," bawled the
announcer. Then the whistle shrilled and the
boys sprang forward to shake hands. That preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
over, they backed away from each other
and circled around, sparring for an opening.
Francis rushed, but Turner cleverly evaded him.
Again he tried and was thrown off by Turner,
the "spat" of the meeting bodies sounding sharp
and clear in the night air.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Turner. Don't let him get that
grip on you," yelled a Senior as Turner eluded
another bull-like rush which carried both the
contestants in among the torches. It was Francis'
method of wrestling to carry the fight fast
and furious from the beginning. More skirmishing,
and finally a savage rush, and Francis got
a hold on Turner's leg, lifted him from his feet
and threw him backwards. Both crashed to the
ground. There was a twisting, squirming struggle
with Turner at the bottom, but not downed
yet for he managed to break away from Francis'
hold and got to his hands and knees with Francis
across his back.</p>

<p>The picture at this point was one worthy of
the brush of an artist. Riding in a clear sky, a
round moon looked down through the branches
of the big elms to where the boys fought it out
on the grass, panting with their exertions. Most
of the torches had by this time burned themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
out and lay smoking at the feet of the human
circle. For a background to the picture hundreds
of lights twinkled on in the dormitory
windows facing the Campus, and in the dim
light of the moon could be seen scores of people
who had taken advantage of the Dwight Hall
porch from whence they could get a distant view
of the struggle.</p>

<p>But the boys struggling on the ground and
those crowded around the ring were not interested
in the pictures. Back and forth the wrestlers
went, the advantage first with one and then
with the other. Francis could not get his famous
holds on Turner for the latter, with extraordinary
strength, either evaded or broke them before
he was caught irrevocably. Time was up
for the bout before either had scored a fall.</p>

<p>"Keep him off, Turner," counseled one of his
seconds, while he pummeled the wrestler's arm
and shoulder muscles. "Tire him out in this next
bout, and you will get him in the last one."</p>

<p>"Don't let him get that half-Nelson on you
or you are going sure as shooting," advised the
man who fanned the panting Turner with a
towel. "You've taken some of the confidence
out of him already."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis in his corner was getting the same
kind of advice.</p>

<p>"You'll get him this time," cheered his advisers.
"Carry it right to him and don't let him
get out of your grips."</p>

<p>"He's strong," said Francis. "He nearly
broke my arm, but I'll get him. Don't worry."
But the confident smile had gone from his face.
It was going to be a bitter struggle in which
his skill was pretty nearly evened by the Freshman's
unusual strength.</p>

<p>"Ready," shouted the referee, and once again
the boys sprang at each other. Francis was more
cautious this time; Turner watchful and wary.
Round and round they circled until Turner seeing
what he thought was an opportunity rushed
with such a tremendous drive that Francis, unable
to escape, was borne off his feet. He managed
to save himself from a bad position by
driving Turner's head down, and mounting his
back, rode half way round the ring like an old
man of the mountains, while the crowd yelled
and laughed. The laughter seemed to madden
Jimmy. With a herculean effort he freed himself
from Francis who dropped to the ground on
hands and knees firmly braced. Using all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
strength to turn him over without success, Jimmy
relaxed his muscles, rested for a moment, and
then putting every pound of energy into one
supreme effort, picked his opponent up by the
middle and threw him backwards over his head.
Francis struck on his shoulder, rolled over on
his back and lay still. He had been stunned by
the fall.</p>

<p>A little fanning brought Francis back to consciousness,
but he had enough for that night, and
the referee awarded the bout to Turner. A few
moments of conference and the announcer
cried:</p>

<p>"Turner wins the middleweight bout for the
Freshmen. The third bout will not be pulled
off."</p>

<p>The Freshman cheer that went up rattled the
windows in Durfee Hall. As Turner was putting
on his clothes, and while calls were going
out for heavyweight candidates, a man wearing
the 'Varsity Y stepped up to him.</p>

<p>"Do you play football?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little," said Turner, rubbing tenderly
a red welt across his right forearm, which had
been raised by one of the Sophomore's love taps.</p>

<p>"Report to me at the Field next Monday. I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the Freshman football coach. Maybe I can use
you."</p>

<p>Turner thrilled. "So the old Codfish didn't
get me in wrong after all. I'll forgive him," he
thought to himself. Finished with his dressing,
he was allowed to pass through the thinning
wall of spectators, and was picked up by Frank
who had wriggled from his position with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Great stuff, Jimmy," cried Frank. "It was
worth real money to see you in action!"</p>

<p>"I don't deserve any credit for it," said Turner.
"I happened to get a lucky lift on him.
He knows more about the game than I'll ever
learn. I hope I didn't hurt him."</p>

<p>"Never fear, his pride was hurt more than
his body," returned Frank. "I wonder where
Hercules Gleason went to. He disappeared after
his meteoric burst of wrestling form."</p>

<p>"As I'm a sinner, there he is now," exclaimed
Jimmy, pointing to a dejected figure leaning
against the bole of a huge elm tree. The boys
pranced up to him, and sure enough it was the
Codfish, mussed and bedraggled. Great blotches
of green grass stain ornamented his beautiful
light gray trousers, and one knee peered out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
through a six-inch rent which had been made
when his overzealous opponent dragged him
along the ground in the second bout. His usually
sleek hair was all awry and a zigzag scratch
beautified the side of his face.</p>

<p>"How did you like my début?" he asked
weakly.</p>

<p>"Great, but how in the name of Mike and the
rest of the family did you come to get roped in?"</p>

<p>"They noticed my special fitness for the job,
I guess," murmured the Codfish, "and they threw
me into the ring, and when I got there, what
was there left but to take my medicine?"</p>

<p>"Who was it that chucked you over our heads,
and why didn't you follow us when we made a
break?" demanded Frank.</p>

<p>"O, you ducked off so fast that I lost track
of you, and then while I was hunting around for
you a bunch of fellows came along and asked me
if I were a Freshman."</p>

<p>"And you said no, of course," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"No, I said yes with the result as you saw it.
I was lucky to escape with my life. How that
Sophomore came to let me throw him is more
than I can understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the blue socks that did it," declared
Frank. "He simply couldn't withstand them."</p>

<p>"Come on home," said the Codfish, groaning.
"I'm a mess."</p>

<p>"Not till this match is over," said Frank.
"We've got to stick by the class. There's one for
us I guess," as Freshmen yells betokened a fall
for the candidate of the youngest class in the
heavyweight match now going on desperately
in the ring they had left.</p>

<p>Five minutes more, and a great burst of cheering
announced the end of the match with the
Freshman candidate a winner.</p>

<p>"That gives us the championship," shouted
Frank, and the three friends grasped each other
about the shoulders and whirled around in a wild
dance, the Codfish favoring his lame knee as
much as possible.</p>

<p>Like magic the great crowd of students faded
from the Campus and headed for York street.
At the corner of High street and Elm the gang
of town roughs, now augmented to a hundred or
more, yelled defiance at the students, and occasionally
fell upon some of them who were on
the outskirts of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Look out for your caps," came the warning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
but it was not given soon enough to prevent some
of the unwary from losing their headgear at the
hands of the roughs who were out for the particular
business that night of cap-snatching. Hot
blows were struck, the whole body of students
uniting against the common enemy. At every
few steps a rough, backed by a half dozen of
his pals, dashed into the students and for a moment
there would be a whirlwind of fighting,
ending generally in the attacking party beating
a retreat with bloody noses but with the prized
cap trophies.</p>

<p>Keeping out of the fighting, the three friends
moved slowly with the crowd in the direction of
Pierson Hall on York street, where their rooms
were located. Frank supported the crippled Codfish
with an arm around his waist. Jimmy appointed
himself as rear guard, keeping a wary
lookout for attacks.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the crowd swooped two
roughs and charged full at Frank and the Codfish,
bowling them over like nine-pins. One of
the roughs grabbed Gleason's cap, which he was
unwise enough to wear, and with it a handful
of his hair. This brought a blood-curdling yell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
from the victim of the assault, and drew the attention
of the crowd.</p>

<p>For the second time that night Jimmy went
into action. A well-delivered punch knocked the
cap-snatcher into the street, but before he could
do more execution he was set on by a half dozen
of the snatcher's friends who had followed
closely on their companion's heels. Frank
dropped the Codfish and sprang to Jimmy's
assistance, and in a second a scrap of major proportions
was in full swing. The boys put up a
whirlwind argument with their fists, and were
holding their own when through the mass came
ploughing two officers of the law, the light flashing
on their brass buttons.</p>

<p>"Police, police, beat it!" yelled the roughs, and
they fled precipitately, all excepting the two that
Frank and Jimmy were pummeling with such
exceeding vigor that they didn't have time to
escape.</p>

<p>Into the circle where the fight was going on
strode the officers with clubs drawn.</p>

<p>"Quit it and come with us," said one of the
policemen. "We're going to put a stop to this
street fighting. A night in the lock-up will take
some of the spunk out of you fellows. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on," and each grabbed an arm of Armstrong and
Turner while the roughs who had started the
trouble, with terrified looks, turned, dashed
through the crowd, and made their escape.</p>

<p>"They snatched my cap," said the Codfish.</p>

<p>"So you were in it, too? You better come
along with your friends," said one of the officers,
reaching for Gleason's arm.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take the roughs that started
the muss?" remonstrated Frank.</p>

<p>"No lip, young fellow," said the officer, scowling
and shaking his club. Both policemen
started forward, pushing their captors ahead of
them, but the crowd blocked the way and began
to hoot and yell. It looked like serious trouble
for a minute when, shouldering through the
crowd, came a giant of a man wearing the uniform
of the University police.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, boys?" he said in a soft
tone.</p>

<p>"These young fellows were fighting and we're
going to jug them for a while."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't do that, now," urged the soft
voice. "Maybe they had a reason. Let me take
charge of them. They're good boys."</p>

<p>"They were defending themselves," said a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
man who stepped forward from the ring of spectators.
"I saw the muss and these boys are not
to blame." Turner recognized in the speaker
the man who had asked him to report at the
Field the next week, and his heart sank. It was
a bad way to start his Yale career, he thought.</p>

<p>"Let me take them in charge," urged the University
officer, and reluctantly the City policemen
released their holds on the offenders.</p>

<p>"Well, see that they don't get into trouble
again on the streets or you can't save them."</p>

<p>"O, I'll take care of them," and then to Frank,
"Come on, boys, let's go over to your room. I
wouldn't have you fighting for the world. It
isn't a good way to start, you know."</p>

<p>"We simply couldn't help it," Turner burst
out. "What would you do in such a case?"</p>

<p>"O, I'd just naturally run," said the officer,
and a laugh shook his huge bulk.</p>

<p>"But if you couldn't run?" urged Turner.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd just naturally have to fight, I
s'pose," and he laughed again his good-natured
laugh which had numberless times quieted turbulent
spirits. "We'll forgive you this time.
Now where do you live? I'll see you to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
rooms. You've had enough fun for the night."</p>

<p>"We live together at Pierson, just around the
corner," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Come on then," said the officer, and accompanied
by a cheering crowd, the procession
moved onward while the roughs, regaining some
of their courage, followed at a safe distance and
jeered.</p>

<p>The boys gained their room without further
trouble, and for an hour looked down on the
seething mass on York street below where the
classes pushed and struggled in good-natured
fun.</p>

<p>"Well, it's been some evening," said the Codfish
reminiscently as he daubed arnica on his
bruised knee.</p>

<p>"Yes, Yale seems to be a lively little place,"
said Turner. "Hand me over that arnica when
you have done with it. I have a few tender
spots myself."</p>

<p>"I'll have a lick at it when you are through
with it, Jimmy," laughed Frank. "I lost a yard
of skin in the last mêlée. I hope they don't have
many nights like this. I wouldn't last."</p>

<p>Sore and bruised the three crawled into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
beds, but the sting of broken skin could not stifle
the feeling of radiant happiness that was theirs
because at last they were "Yale men," and a
part of the great institution about which their
dreams had so long centered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III. <span class="subtit">THE CODFISH CREATES NEWS.</span></h2>

<p>Golden October, slipping rapidly by, found our
boys settled comfortably in their college life.
The first week was a hard one for them all, but
as time went on they adjusted themselves to their
surroundings, began to make acquaintances and
easily dropped into the daily routine of work and
play. Frank and Jimmy had gone out for the
Freshman football team, and the latter was now
a recognized member of the squad with great
hopes for the future.</p>

<p>Frank had been unfortunate. On the third
day of practice he twisted an ankle and had been
obliged to sit on the side-lines watching his fellows
boom along under instruction of the coach
while he saw his chances gradually growing slimmer.
To-day he had gone out again and after
half an hour again wrenched the bad ankle. It
would be another week at least before he could
think of playing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are the best representation of Gloom I
ever saw pulled off," said the Codfish that night
as Frank hobbled into the room after dinner at
Commons, and threw himself into a chair.</p>

<p>"My jinx seem to be working overtime," returned
Frank, "and my guardian angel is out
visiting somewhere. Did you ever see such
luck?" and he deposited the injured leg on the
chair in front of him.</p>

<p>"Bad judgment, my boy, bad judgment. You
should have gone in for the less strenuous sport
of rowing as I have," admonished the Codfish.</p>

<p>"A lazy, sit-down job and one for which you
are peculiarly fitted," broke in Jimmy Turner.</p>

<p>"Ah, but my boy, if you can win your Y sitting
down, isn't it better than to be mauled by
bear-cats every day? I belong to the antisweat
brigade."</p>

<p>"The only Y you will ever get is the one you
find in your soup," Jimmy flung at him.</p>

<p>"Stranger things than that have happened,
Mr. Turner."</p>

<p>"Yes, blue moons, for instance."</p>

<p>Codfish, fired by the general fever for something
to do outside of the classroom, had indeed
enlisted himself as a candidate for the coxswain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the crew, because, as he said, "You only had
to sit still, pull ropes now and then and talk."
He had been out as one of the coxswains and
had shown some aptitude in spite of the fact that
he knew nothing whatever about rowing.</p>

<p>"I'm paralyzed with amazement," said Frank,
looking the Codfish over quizzically, "that you
ever got ginger enough into your system to even
do sit-down work."</p>

<p>"Well, you see it was this way," returned the
crew squad-man, crossing one thin leg over the
other. "I went down there to the boat house
one day, merely to look on, to see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To see how the young idea was shooting,
eh?" grunted Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Precisely. And when the coaches saw me
they were struck with my peculiar&mdash;ahem&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Unfitness!"</p>

<p>"Wrong again, the phrase I was going to use
was, 'peculiar fitness,' fitness, do you get it? for
the job, and begged me to help them out."</p>

<p>"And you helped?"</p>

<p>"What could I do? Other things are claiming
my attention but I could not see rowing go
to the bad down there, so I accepted as gracefully
as I could."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now things are in a rotten state?"</p>

<p>"For the second time, wrong and always
wrong. They are improving daily. Of course,
I'm not in the first boat yet, it would have created
too much jealousy, but I have assurance
from headquarters that I will be moved into the
coveted position of cox of the Freshman crew
as soon as it has been picked."</p>

<p>"Heaven help the first Freshman crew then,"
groaned Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Little do they realize the honor that is shortly
to descend upon them," returned the Codfish,
complacently. "I have some original ideas
about steering a shell which will practically assure
them of the race next June."</p>

<p>"And they are?"</p>

<p>"Why cast pearls before swine? The scheme
will be revealed to you in due season," and the
Codfish pulled a pad of paper toward him and
began to scribble on it industriously.</p>

<p>"You didn't know, perhaps, that I've decided
to go out for the <em>News</em>, did you?" said the Codfish,
scratching away with his head tilted on one
side.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little late in the undertaking?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
inquired Frank. "That is something of a job
for even an intelligent man."</p>

<p>"For an ordinary intellect, yes, but for me a
mere bagatelle, or bag-of-shells, as the ancients
have it."</p>

<p>"Heeling the <em>News</em> means hours and hours of
shacking," said Frank. "Have you seen those
pale ghosts of heelers flitting around by day and
by night on bicycles?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, that's the ordinary way, I know. I
shall deal only in scoops, which, if you follow
me, means a 'beat' on all the other fellows."</p>

<p>"It's a difficult business, sonny."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, a cinch. Watch your Uncle
Dudley. Simply mind over matter. You boneheads
wouldn't understand my reasoning processes
if I explained, so why explain? But I say,
when is David Powers expected in this burg?"</p>

<p>"Arrives on the morning train from New
York," said Frank. "Got in on the <em>Olympic</em> last
night from the other side. Began to think he
was lost."</p>

<p>"Good old Davey. And he's going to be in
Pierson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, right across the hall from us."</p>

<p>"Good, I can use him in my <em>News</em> ambitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Now I guess I'll run across to the <em>News</em> office
and tell the editors I'm ready to start work."</p>

<p>"I hope they kill you," Jimmy shot after him
as the door banged.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the Codfish was back in
the room.</p>

<p>"Well, what happened?" both boys demanded.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"They fired you out after one good look at
you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, they welcomed me with open
arms. Assignment Editor is a peach. He recognized
my ability at once."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"O, kind of naturally doped it out for himself.
General bearing I have, I s'pose. Poor
Freshman bunch heeling the <em>News</em> now, he told
me, and that makes my chances better."</p>

<p>"O, you egotist, you blithering egotist,"
laughed Jimmy.</p>

<p>"No, no, not egotism, just merely confidence.
Now if I were on the Freshman football squad,
I'd just simply know I was going to make the
team, and that's all there'd be to it. I'd make it.
Mind over matter, my boy, mind over matter, as
I was telling you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when do you begin?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"O, I'll knock off a little something in the
morning. I've an hour after ten-thirty recitation.
I asked the Assignment Editor to save
me a column on the front page, in view of a
scoop I contemplate. Hand me that paper, Turner,"
indicating the evening paper which lay on
the floor at Jimmy's feet.</p>

<p>Turner tossed it over to him, and Codfish at
once buried himself in its columns. After ten
minutes' reading, the Codfish slapped his knee
with a resounding slap and gave evidence of excitement.</p>

<p>"What's up, old top?" inquired Frank, looking
up from his book.</p>

<p>"Basis for a scoop first lick out of the box,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"O, read it in the <em>News</em> day after to-morrow,"
and the Codfish settled himself to lay out his
plans. He had come across an item which suggested
something in the way of a story which
would attract the attention of the whole college.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of the Codfish the next day.
He explained to his roommates that he had taken
two cuts and had gone into the suburbs on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
exploring expedition. He had hardly time to
welcome David Powers who arrived in due season,
and was properly installed among his belongings
in the room across the hallway. But
the following morning as with Frank and Jimmy
he strolled across the Campus to Osborn Hall
for the first recitation after Chapel, he proudly
exhibited a copy of the <em>News</em>. On the first page
in black type was emblazoned the head:</p>

<p class="center fp spaced">
EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY.<br />
BONES OF PREHISTORIC ANIMAL UNEARTHED
BY WORKMEN PRESENTED
TO YALE
MUSEUM.<br />
SAID TO BE MOST IMPORTANT FIND
IN RECENT YEARS.
</p>

<p>Then followed a description of the bones
which were represented to be those of a prehistoric
horse of a species not before known to the
paleontologists. The article ended with the information
that the bones had been carefully preserved,
and had been presented, or would shortly
be presented, to the Yale Museum by the <em>News</em>
representative who had had a prominent part in
their recovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The Codfish puffed out his chest as Frank and
Jimmy scanned the article. "What do you think
of your humble roommate now, eh, what?
Didn't I tell you to read it in the <em>News?</em>"</p>

<p>"So that's what bit you the other night?"</p>

<p>"Sure. The ordinary eye would have passed
that item over without a thought, but I saw possibilities
in it. You never saw so many bones,"
he added. "Fine bones, perfectly fine bones, just
as good as any over in the Museum, and a lot
whiter than most of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, but who told you they belonged to the
prehistoric horse?"</p>

<p>"O, the foreman of the gang. He was a
keen guy, I tell you, knew all about the game
and got me so enthusiastic that I bought the
whole bunch for ten dollars. They'll have a
chance to mull over them up at the Museum in a
day or two."</p>

<p>"More likely they are the remains of some
poor bossy," said Jimmy, "who laid down and
died yesteryear."</p>

<p>"You are the most disgusting pessimist I
know," said the Codfish in high dudgeon.
"Haven't they as good a chance to be old-fashioned
bones as anything? Anyway I got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
story in and a credit of five thousand words at
least on the scoop. The fact that I bought them
and presented them to the Museum should be
worth another bunch of credit to me, but I'll
work that up into a new story that will knock
their eye out."</p>

<p>"But Lord help you if you've put the <em>News</em> in
wrong," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Tush, tush," was all that Codfish would say,
"don't discourage the efforts of a budding
genius."</p>

<p>Several days later three expressmen might
have been seen carrying most carefully a gigantic
packing box labeled:</p>

<p class="center fp spaced">
RELICS&mdash;WITH CARE.
</p>

<p class="fp">and addressed to the Peabody Museum. Behind
it marched the Codfish.</p>

<p>"Round the back way," he commanded. "You
can't get in the front way. Easy there. You're
carrying the most important thing you ever handled."</p>

<p>"It's darn'd heavy," grunted one of the men.</p>

<p>"That's because it's so valuable," admonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the guardian of the box. "Don't drop it, on your
life; it's a prehistoric horse."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is, give me a historic one. He
must be solid stone."</p>

<p>"No, only solid bone, like your head. Easy
there!"</p>

<p>Stumbling and grunting the men carried the
box as gingerly as they could around to the back
of the Museum.</p>

<p>The Codfish left his precious possession, and
hunted around in the gloomy depths of the basement
of the Museum among the giant bones of
long extinct mammals which lined the corridors.</p>

<p>"They must all be ossified here," he muttered
to himself, but as he was about to give up the
search for something living in that forbidding
cavern, he came upon an apron-clad man who
looked him over curiously.</p>

<p>"Well," said he of the apron.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for the bone man," said the Codfish
somewhat abashed.</p>

<p>"You're in the wrong museum, you want the
dime kind."</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I want the bone professor."</p>

<p>"O, the bone professor, eh? Well, I'm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
man," he said, while the suspicion of a smile
crossed the pale features. "What's wanted?"</p>

<p>"Got a bunch of bones out here for you, great
stuff, too."</p>

<p>"Whose bones?"</p>

<p>"O, it's something that will interest you. I've
presented them to the Museum."</p>

<p>"You have, eh? That's kind of you. Didn't
you think we had enough?" glancing around at
the tiers of cases and the tons of uncased bones
lying on the floor.</p>

<p>"O, but you've got nothing like these. These
are the whitest bones you ever saw, belonged to
a prehistoric horse or something of that kind.
Don't you read the <em>News?</em> Take a look at them.
Where do you want them put?"</p>

<p>The "bone professor" called a workman who,
with a hatchet, soon had the cover of the packing
case ripped off, exposing the great find of the
Codfish.</p>

<p>"This is a poor joke," said the professor, the
danger light beginning to flash in his eye. "Take
them out of this."</p>

<p>"Why, aren't they good bones? Didn't they
belong to a prehistoric horse?"</p>

<p>"A prehistoric jackass, and you are a direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
descendant," shouted the professor. "I won't
have you or your bones around here. You've
dug up a domestic animal cemetery somewhere.
Off with them," and he turned on his heel and
plunged into the basement without so much as
another look at the discoverer of the prehistoric
horse.</p>

<p>"And to think that I paid ten dollars to get
them here," reflected the Codfish. "Science can
go hang in the future. Here," to the driver of
the wagon, "take this blooming box of bones away
somewhere and lose it forever."</p>

<p>"It'll take five dollars to lose it right," said
the driver, who with his two assistants, had hung
around, grinning broadly at the discomfiture of
the friend of science.</p>

<p>"It's worth five to have it lost," said the Codfish
as he went into his pocket for the necessary
bill, "and if I ever see it or you again, beware
of your life."</p>

<p>"We'll take it to the soap factory, eh?"</p>

<p>"No chance," said the Codfish gloomily. "The
bones are not old enough for the Museum and
too old for the factory. Eat them if you want
to, only get rid of them somehow. I'm off," and
he strode out to High street in a rage. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Codfish had the newspaper man's sense, and that
night wrote an article for his paper which explained
that the find was only "semiprehistoric,
and as such did not have the value that it was
first supposed to have in spite of the authority
of the first testimony."</p>

<p>The Codfish did not know till later that his
prehistoric stories netted him less than nothing,
for he was docked ten thousand words by the
<em>News</em> board for handing in an article which contained
so much misinformation.</p>

<p>In such ways do the Fates trip up even unselfish
friends of science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV. <span class="subtit">MAKING THE ELEVEN.</span></h2>

<p>"I'd give good money, if I had it," quoth
Turner, "to have to-morrow's game over and
won." Half a dozen boys were gathered in the
Pierson Hall rooms, and the talk was on the
Exeter game which was to be played on the
morrow.</p>

<p>"Why so timid?" spoke up the Codfish, who
was planning another assault on the <em>News</em> columns.</p>

<p>"This Exeter team is good, awfully good.
Did you see what they did to Hotchkiss last
week?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;16 to 0."</p>

<p>"And what was our score against Hotchkiss?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to 6."</p>

<p>"Figuring at that rate it will be an interesting
occasion for us to-morrow afternoon," said
Frank Armstrong gloomily. "But then," more
cheerfully, "you can never tell what will happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in football. If our friend James Turner
could get away on one of his dashing runs, right
early in the game, it might be a help."</p>

<p>"I haven't been dashing much lately," said
Turner. "My dashing has been chiefly on the
ground."</p>

<p>"The worm may turn," suggested Butcher
Brown, a broad-shouldered and loosely built
young chap who played a tackle position on the
second Freshman eleven, and who lived on the
same floor in Pierson, at the end of the corridor.</p>

<p>"Speaking of worms," observed the Codfish,
"did you notice the <em>News</em> this morning?"</p>

<p>"I saw it was printed as usual," said Frank.
"Some good football news on the first page?"</p>

<p>"Always thinking of football. Did you happen
to look in the crew notices? Of course, you
didn't."</p>

<p>"What was it? Tell us. Have you been promoted?"</p>

<p>"Promoted is the word," said the Codfish
proudly. "I have the honor to announce to
you, since you didn't read it for yourself, that
I'm to guide the destinies of the third Freshman
crew henceforth."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I'm not on it, then," said Turner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"And," continued the Codfish undaunted by
Turner's shot, "in about a week I'll land in the
seat of the first eight. They are very fond of
my style down there at the boathouse."</p>

<p>"Your line of talk I suppose is so overpowering
that the crew rows hard to get away from
it."</p>

<p>"Don't be sarcastic, Armstrong. It doesn't
fit your particular style of beauty. You are
peeved because you can't make the Freshman
football team, and, of course, I don't blame you,
but try not to be jealous of me."</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "Go it, old bird," he said.
"We're too fond of you to be jealous, but remember
the old proverb: 'Pride goeth before a fall!'"</p>

<p>"Watch me," said the Codfish. "Proverbs
don't fit my case," and the Codfish busied himself
over a pile of correspondence.</p>

<p>"Why such industry?" inquired Turner, after
a few minutes of silence broken only by the
scratching of the Codfish's pen.</p>

<p>"Read it in the <em>News</em>, my son. I'm going to
have a red-hot scoop to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Let us in on it."</p>

<p>"Not on your life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has it anything to do with prehistoric
horses?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. Better than that. This one
will make them all sit up and take notice. There
ought to be about ten thousand words credit in
this one. I can see the road clear to an editorship
on that ancient and honorable sheet. When
I get on the Board, I'll see to it that all football
games are very carefully reported, and that your
glaring mistakes are not brought out too prominently."</p>

<p>"Thanks, very much," said Turner, laughing.
"You're a confident little rooster. For a man
who talks so much you get very little into that
same <em>News</em>, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you I can get a front page article
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I'm not a betting man," said Turner. "Moreover
I don't want to take your money."</p>

<p>"Quitter," retorted the Codfish. "I'll bet you
for fun, money or beans."</p>

<p>"I haven't had any fun for the last three
weeks. I have no money, and beans are scarce."</p>

<p>"Then I'll show you, anyway. Read the <em>News</em>
in the morning," and grabbing a handful of
manuscript the Codfish dashed out the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
slamming it vigorously behind him as was his
habit.</p>

<p>An hour later, just as the boys were about to
turn in for the night, Jim, the University officer,
pushed the door open and entered.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys," said the officer, seating himself
in a big armchair and puffing with the climb of
three flights of stairs. "Do you have a fellow
named Gleason rooming here, a <em>News</em> heeler?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Frank, "that's the Codfish."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the officer. "Well, he's been
pinched."</p>

<p>"What, arrested?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. He's down at the lock-up now.
Captain just telephoned me to see if I could
locate his friends."</p>

<p>"What was he up to?"</p>

<p>"Riding a bicycle on the Chapel street sidewalk."</p>

<p>"But he has no bicycle, it would be too much
like work for him to ride one."</p>

<p>"Well, he must have borrowed it then, because
he was pulled in by one of the city men for breaking
the ordinance against riding on the sidewalk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"The nut," ejaculated Turner. "He should
have known better than that."</p>

<p>"We've got to get him out of hock," said
Frank.</p>

<p>"I guess you will if he gets out to-night," returned
the officer, laughing, "and it takes about
fifty dollars bail to do it."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other, aghast. "Fifty
dollars!" they said. "That's a lot of money."</p>

<p>"Take up a collection," suggested the officer,
"and I'll go down to the station with you. It
has got to be cash. They won't accept checks
for bail, you know."</p>

<p>Frank and Jimmy brought forth their rolls,
but when they had laid all their cash on the table
they were still short a matter of twenty-five dollars.
In this emergency David Powers was
called upon across the hall, and he advanced the
necessary funds.</p>

<p>At the Police Headquarters they found the
Codfish installed in the Captain's room, writing
industriously.</p>

<p>"Just in time," said the Captain. "I was just
going to put him in the cooler. I think he ought
to spend the night with us, anyway. Teach him
a lesson."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The Codfish continued his writing unconcernedly
for a minute, sighed with satisfaction,
folded up the paper and put it in his pocket.
"When the formalities are complied with, I'll
go along with you. Have you got the bail?" he
said to Frank, who was gazing at him in amazement.</p>

<p>The money was soon paid over, and the Codfish
was released from the grip of the law with
instructions to be on hand for the opening of the
city court at nine o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>"You crazy nut," said Jimmy, on the way up
to Pierson Hall. "How did you come to get
pinched?"</p>

<p>"Method in my madness, old top. Let's swing
around to the <em>News</em> office. I've got a couple of
articles for them, two more scoops."</p>

<p>"And what are they?"</p>

<p>"O, read the <em>News</em> in the morning," said the
Codfish, joyfully. "You wouldn't understand
the workings of the genius mind like this," tapping
his forehead, "if I told you."</p>

<p>The boys swung over to Elm street, and the
Codfish handed in two articles at the <em>News</em> office,
and then went along with his friends. "It
always gives me a feeling of deep exhaustion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
see those heelers working so hard on that sheet."</p>

<p>"Do they work hard?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"Work hard! Great fishes of the vasty deep,
they put in an amount of hours that ought to
make you football fellows blush with shame, if
you could blush. The ordinary news-heeler
doesn't have time to eat his meals."</p>

<p>"You don't cut out many, I notice," laughed
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm not the ordinary kind."</p>

<p>"I've heard you say that before."</p>

<p>"These other fellows chase little bits of things
for news' sake, while I create news for my sake.
Get the difference?"</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;O," said Frank. "You created some
the other day&mdash;some bone news."</p>

<p>"'Still harping on my daughter,' as one
William Shakespeare said some moons since?
Can't you give that a rest and turn your mind
to the present? Never worry about the dead
past, is my motto. Even Napoleon made mistakes,
to say nothing of Turner, eh Jimmy?"</p>

<p>Reaching the Pierson room, the Codfish threw
himself into a big chair and sighed luxuriously.
"Great day's work. Although I started late on
this competition I must be nearly up to the leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
now, and a little more hustling will shoot me to
the front."</p>

<p>"What an ego!" exclaimed Frank. "But now
in the privacy of our own room, will you kindly
tell me, why, how and what for did you get
yourself in the hands of the law to-night, whose
bicycle was it you borrowed, and when are we
going to get the money we advanced to release
your worthless carcass from hock?"</p>

<p>"My, what a lot of questions. Do you mean
to tell me you haven't visioned my scheme, a
bright young fellow like you? Pshaw, pshaw,
Armstrong, I didn't think it of you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead and elucidate, Sherlock Holmes!"</p>

<p>"It seems hardly necessary, but it is said, and
truly I now perceive, that brains and brawn are
not kindred attributes of the genus football man.
In a word, I got myself pinched, and thereby
made news for the <em>News</em>. Savez?"</p>

<p>"You got arrested on purpose to write up your
own arrest?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, surest thing you ever knew.
Made a pretty little story of it, touched on the
brutality of the officer who hauled me into the
station, and, incidentally, made a strong plea
for the use of the city sidewalks by heelers on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
bicycles when the streets are as dusty as they
are now, to say nothing of a little hit at the
lack of courtesy accorded the Yale student by
the ordinary, garden variety of policeman."</p>

<p>"And this is what we provided good money
for!" said Frank.</p>

<p>Turner advanced threateningly upon the offender.
"This is what we were dragged from
our room in the dead hour of night for, this is
the thing for which we deposited our good
money! I hope they give you a thousand dollars
and costs, and send you to jail for a year, to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"O, yes," continued the Codfish, not noticing
Turner's outburst, "and I forgot, I wrote another
little item suggesting that the Criminal
Club, of which I am now a member in good
standing, and which has fallen into decay, be rejuvenated
and reëstablished in its glory of the
olden days."</p>

<p>"Well, you've had your trouble for nothing,
old lunatic. The <em>News</em> won't print anything like
that."</p>

<p>"If they don't, they don't know good news
when they see it."</p>

<p>"Costly news, I should say," grunted Frank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"Costly with our money. We want our money
back and fifty per cent. interest for the wear and
tear on our constitutions in this night air."</p>

<p>"I'll pay it to you out of my dividends from
the <em>News</em> Board when I cash in."</p>

<p>"Then we'll never get it," groaned Jimmy.
"I'm going to bed. Codfish has absolutely gone
nutty."</p>

<p>"That's always said about geniuses by ordinary
folks, old top. Time alone will prove who
is the nutty gent," the Codfish shot after him
as Turner went into his bedroom.</p>

<p>The next morning the college was agog with
excitement about the proposed flight of aeroplanes
over Yale field some time during the afternoon
while the football game was in progress.
Details of the flight were given in the Yale <em>News</em>,
the names and histories of the aviators and the
types of machines to fly. It was further stated
that one of the flyers would loop-the-loop in full
view of the crowds in the stands. The Codfish
was bursting with pride at the sensation he had
sprung, for it was his story which had set the
college talking.</p>

<p>"It's knocking their eye out," he boasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it coming off?" inquired Frank incredulously.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's coming off. It cost me a cool two
hundred and fifty to get them here, and I've
had a dickens of a time keeping it quiet."</p>

<p>"So that's what you've been at these last three
days, is it?" said Turner.</p>

<p>"A week, my boy, you can't do big things like
that in three days. This ought to give me a
lead in the race. Eh, what?"</p>

<p>"A race for your life, if it doesn't come off."</p>

<p>"Always skeptical, no imagination, typical
football type, slow to grasp an idea. If you had
read the papers you would have seen that they're
having a flying meet down at Bridgeport. With
a little lubricant in the shape of cash, the rest
was easy."</p>

<p>A great crowd journeyed to Yale Field that
afternoon, so great that it resembled in a measure
the days of the big football games. With
three events scheduled&mdash;a Freshman game, a
'Varsity game and a flying exhibition, all in one
afternoon, thousands were drawn in the direction
of the field, and the football manager chortled
with joy as he saw the shekels going into
his treasury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The games came and went, but no fliers hove
in sight. The Freshmen were overwhelmed by
the big Exeter team, and after that was over the
'Varsity proceeded to punch holes in their opponents.
The spectators divided their attention
between the field and the sky, but nothing came.
The nearest thing to an aeroplane that appeared
during the afternoon was a large hawk which
floated up from the southwest, and volplaned
down from the heights. For a moment it raised
false hopes. The crowd reluctantly filed out of
the big stands as darkness began to settle over
the field and still no flying men put in their appearance.</p>

<p>The Codfish was puzzled but not alarmed.
Nothing could disturb his buoyant nature. He
rode back to the city on a car loaded with people
who indignantly proclaimed a fake by the Yale
<em>News</em> for the purpose of drawing a larger attendance
for the game, but although he heard,
the Codfish kept his own counsel. Arriving at
his room he found a telegram from the manager
of the meet at Bridgeport, notifying him that
owing to a disagreement among the fliers, they
would not be able to come to New Haven at all,
and that his check would be returned next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, this lets me out," soliloquized the promoter
of the flying meet. "I'll write this up, describe
the disagreement in detail, and hand it in
for Monday's paper. Great thought," he added
aloud, "more credit for yours truly. We play
them both ways and the middle, there's no chance
to lose."</p>

<p>Just then Frank and Jimmy came in. The
game had not been one to enliven their spirits.
They were caustic in their remarks to the Codfish.</p>

<p>"You are certainly a bum flying meet promoter,"
said Frank. "With two such stories as
you have pulled off in our conservative little
<em>News</em>, you might as well die."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I've just begun a little
story," as indeed he had, "which will explain the
matter satisfactorily. Fliers are said to be uncertain
birds anyway, and I guess they are. This
story," he added, "will put me straight with the
editors and the editors straight with the college.
No harm done at all. Exhibition arranged, all
in good faith, some aviator has the pip, no flight,
telegram explains, I explain, more news at every
turn, and there you are."</p>

<p>"Yes, and there you are," said Turner scowling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
"Your roommates get the blame for not
letting you be locked up, as you should be."</p>

<p>"O, I didn't see you scoring any touchdowns
to-day. Come in," he yelled as a knock came on
the door. A young Freshman heeler entered
with a note which he handed to the promoter of
the flying exhibition. "From the <em>News</em>," he
added and went out.</p>

<p>The Codfish took the letter and tore off the end
of the envelope. "Big assignment I imagine, expected
as much, they're beginning to see I'm onto
my job."</p>

<p>But as the Codfish read, a change came over
his face. He went through the short note once
and then again, while his roommates watched him
curiously.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, an assignment, eh?" said
Frank. "Something big?"</p>

<p>"An assignment, yes," returned the Codfish
weakly, "an assignment to quit. What do you
think of this?" and he read aloud:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="fp nomargin">
"G. W. Gleason,</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Fired, by gosh," said the Codfish.</p>

<p>"Fired it is," said Turner. "I knew your zeal
would carry you over the falls."</p>

<p>"Well, I had a good time going, anyway."</p>

<p>"O, I say," said Frank, "what did they give
you at City Court this morning?"</p>

<p>"Five dollars and costs, not much for the experience.
It was worth all the trouble. Experience
is what I live for."</p>

<p>"You funny duffer," said Frank, laughing.
"Now pay up," and the Codfish did.</p>

<p>"Well, there's one thing I still have left, my
crew job. They can't shake me there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V. <span class="subtit">FRANK LEARNS TO TACKLE THE DUMMY.</span></h2>

<p>"How does that ankle feel?" inquired the
Freshman coach of Frank Armstrong one afternoon
at practice on the week following the Exeter
game. "I see you stepping around quite
lively on it."</p>

<p>"I think it is good enough, sir," said Frank.
It was far from a well ankle, but Frank was
desperately anxious to get into the game from
which he had been denied on account of his accident,
and was willing to take a chance with it.
He had felt that he was going to be overlooked
entirely in spite of the fact that he had kept in
training and had done as much as he could under
the conditions.</p>

<p>"Good enough then. Do you know the signals?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, then take some practice now and later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
I want to try you at quarter on the Second. You
played there on your prep. school team, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Frank, his heart jumping at
the thought that he was to have his chance, after
all.</p>

<p>"All of you over to the 'Varsity field," commanded
the coach. "The exhibition of tackling
in that Exeter game was enough to make a strong
man weep, not a half dozen clean ones in the
whole game. I'll teach you to stop a man or
kill you in the attempt," and Coach Howard, with
a determined face, led his squad into the great
wooden amphitheater where at one end below the
goal line stood two tackling dummies, looking
very much like gallows, each with the canvas-clad
shape of a man dangling from a rope over
a pit of sawdust and loam. There had been
some tackling practice early in the season in
which Frank had not participated on account of
his injured ankle, so the experience for him
to-day was to be a new one.</p>

<p>"Now, this is the way, watch me carefully,"
said Howard. "Start from here," indicating a
point about fifty feet from the dummy, "get
under way quickly, increase your speed toward
the end of the run, spring off one foot, not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
dive, remember, strike the dummy with your
shoulder just under the hips, and wrap your
arms around the legs. This way," and suiting
the action to the word, Howard, who was in
football uniform, dashed at the swinging figure,
struck it with a crash, carried it from its fastening
on a clean, driving tackle.</p>

<p>"Now line up and all take your turn," said
the coach as he came back to the group. "Lead
off, Bostwick." Bostwick was an old end from
Andover, who had come down to Yale with a
reputation already made, and who had been
chosen captain of the team.</p>

<p>After Bostwick ran a steady string of the
Freshmen tackling the dummy, some cleanly,
some awkwardly. A field assistant picked up
the canvas-clad figure, and replaced it on the
hook after each savage assault, ready for the
next man, while the coach stood by, offering
criticism and suggestion.</p>

<p>"Too low, too low," he shouted to a candidate.
"Your man would get away from that. Just
what you did Saturday." Or to another, "Don't
slow up; he won't bite you. Drive into him
hard, and carry him right off his feet and keep
a good grip with both hands, both hands," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
yelled as one of the tacklers slapped one arm
around the canvas legs.</p>

<p>It was Frank's turn. He sprinted down the
runway, sprang head-first at the swinging figure,
hit it cleanly, and grasping it tightly with both
arms, crashed down in the sawdust pit.</p>

<p>"Wrong, wrong," cried Howard. "That was
a diving tackle. Your team would be penalized
for that; you've got to make that last step a
long stride, not a jump, remember. Otherwise
it was O. K."</p>

<p>Frank picked himself out of the pit, and
walked back limping a little. He had leaped with
all his vigor from the injured leg, and winced
with the pain of it. But he was not going to
show it. On his second trial he did better, but
was so anxious to favor the ankle that he slowed
up and took a succession of little short steps just
before he sprang, which drew the fire of the
coach down upon him, and caused a smile to go
around the waiting line.</p>

<p>"Afraid of it?" queried the coach, sarcastically.
"It isn't stuffed with anything harder than
excelsior, and it won't bite you."</p>

<p>Frank walked back to his place at the end of
the line crestfallen, but determined to show a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
better result on his next trial. Several of the
'Varsity coaches had strolled over from the other
tackling dummy, where some of the 'Varsity line
men were being put through their paces, and all
of them were on the lookout for likely material
for future 'Varsity teams.</p>

<p>But, try as he might, Frank could not satisfy
the coach. Something was wrong with all his
attempts. The coach did not know that the injured
ankle was throbbing like a toothache.
Frank was afraid to admit it for fear he would
be relegated to the side-line for another period of
waiting. So he blundered through his tackling
at a great disadvantage.</p>

<p>"That's enough," said the coach at last. "You
are a sad bunch at this game, but we'll give you a
daily dose of it and see if it helps any. Come
back to the Freshman field for a scrimmage,"
and followed by his squad of pupils, he led the
way.</p>

<p>That afternoon was a nightmare for Frank.
Favoring his ankle as much as he dared, he ran
the Second team without snap or vigor, and
although he got away on two quarterback runs
for ten or fifteen yards each, and nearly got a
field goal from a difficult angle, he was pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
out of his position and sent to the side-lines before
the scrimmaging was finished, firmly convinced
that he was not cut out for a quarterback.</p>

<p>"This infernal ankle of mine," he grumbled to
Jimmy Turner on their way back in the stuffy
car to the city. "I couldn't do anything. My
leg felt like a stick. I couldn't get out of my
own way."</p>

<p>"I don't think you made much of a hit with
the coach this afternoon," admitted that individual.
"I heard him say to one of the 'Varsity
men, just as we were getting on the car, that
you had some possibilities, but you were too
much afraid of getting hurt."</p>

<p>"He did, did he?" and Frank glared at Coach
Howard who was sitting further up the car
pointing out a play diagram to Madden, the
quarter of the first team. "Thought I was a
nice old lady! I'll show him something if this
leg ever gets better," and he gritted his teeth
in anticipation of the happy time to come when
he could disprove the coach's suspicions.</p>

<p>Handicapped by his bad ankle, and often in
agony with the pain of it on the field, Frank
continued, as the days went by, to fight an up-hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
but losing fight. Turner was daily strengthening
his position at left halfback, and was already
looked upon as of possible 'Varsity caliber
for the next year. While not very fast, he ran
hard and low, and it took an uncommonly hard
tackle to bring him to the ground. He also
had that thing which pleases the coaches, an unfailing
instinct for the ball. Wherever it was,
Turner was not far away.</p>

<p>On the Saturday of that week came the game
with Pawling School. Frank sat on the side-lines
with longing in his heart as he saw his
teammates, for the first time in the season, play a
game worthy of them. The first quarterback,
Madden, ran his team with speed and judgment,
and when the half was finished had driven the
visitors down the field and scored two touchdowns
on them. In the third quarter, Madden
received a hard jolt in the stomach in a scrimmage,
and Frank thrilled as he saw the coach
walk down the side-line, looking for a substitute.
He came on, passed Frank and selected a quarter
named Barlow to take Madden's place, and who
sat just beyond him. Barlow shed his sweater
as he ran, and with a few words from the coach,
sprang into Madden's place behind the center.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Under his guidance another touchdown was
added in the third quarter, and the teams
changed sides for the last period of the game.</p>

<p>Frank gave up hope, as the minutes flew by,
for any chance at that game. Barlow was not
doing so well now, but there was little time to
play. The Pawling team had twice succeeded in
stopping the Freshmen near the Pawling goal
line, and the substitute quarter had fumbled a
punt which for a moment threatened a touchdown
against his team. Bostwick, the vigilant
end, had recovered the ball at midfield, and saved
the situation, but Coach Howard was evidently
anxious. He had made many substitutions to
give new men practice, and had thus weakened
the team, while Pawling seemed to gather new
strength. Down the side-line came Howard
again. This time he stopped opposite Frank.</p>

<p>"I'm going to send you in, Armstrong, to get
a little practice. Hang onto the ball and keep
your head. Steady that line up and look out for
the forward pass. Hurry it up."</p>

<p>But there was no need to tell Frank to hurry.
He had torn off his sweater with the first hint
of his opportunity, and was listening to the
coach with body poised for the run onto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
field. In his eagerness he had entirely forgotten
about the ankle.</p>

<p>With the coming of the new quarterback, the
team took fresh life. Under his urgings, they
began to mow down their opponents as they had
in the first part of the game, and the crowd gathered
along the side-lines expressed their appreciation
of the brace the team was taking in joyous
howls. A pretty forward pass, Turner to
Bostwick, put the ball on Pawling's 15-yard line.</p>

<p>Harrington, the big center, made a bad pass
on the next play, but on a slice outside of tackle,
Turner made five yards. The Pawling team
braced, and cut the advance down on the next
play to a single yard.</p>

<p>Bostwick stepped back to Frank and whispered
something to him. Then he called the whole
team around him, and with arms over each
other's shoulders, they conferred on the next
play. Dropping apart quickly, the linemen
sprang into position.</p>

<p>"Look out for a fake," cried the Pawling
quarter, dancing around in front of the goal
posts.</p>

<p>"A forward pass!" cried another of the backs.</p>

<p>But it was neither a fake nor a forward pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong ran quickly to a point ten yards
behind his crouching line, coolly measured with
his eye the distance from where he stood to the
cross-bar, and a moment later, receiving the ball
on a long, true pass from Harrington, dropped
it to the ground, swung his toe against it as it
rose, and sent it spinning directly between the
posts.</p>

<p>The kick was as pretty a one as could be desired,
and its appreciation was testified to by
jubilant yells and the skyward flight of sweaters
and blankets along the side-lines.</p>

<p>A kick-off at midfield which Turner ran back
30 yards, a single rush, and the whistle ended
the game.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me you could do that?"
said Coach Howard giving Armstrong a hearty
slap on the back as he trotted over to the side-line
to pick up the discarded sweater. "You put
that over like a veteran!"</p>

<p>"Didn't have a chance before," said Frank,
grinning.</p>

<p>"Guess you didn't. Well, I'll see to it that you
get a chance after this." And then, as the throng
of grimy players and the spectators straggled
off to the cars, "I had pretty nearly come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
conclusion that you were too soft for the game
of football."</p>

<p>"My ankle isn't as good as it ought to be," said
Frank, looking down. "I was afraid of doing
more damage to it."</p>

<p>"I'll take a look at that ankle in the gym,"
said Howard. "Maybe we can make a quarterback
of you yet. I want you to come over to the
Freshman training table after this."</p>

<p>It was a joyful gathering in Pierson that
night, with a full attendance, for little by little
the Armstrong-Turner-Gleason-Powers combination
began to have a following in the dormitory
and in the class. Friends began to drop in
to talk over matters of the moment as they passed
to and from their rooms, and if they were the
right kind they always had a welcome. The
room became the central one for spreads and parties,
when the fun raged until ten o'clock.</p>

<p>"All over," Frank would shout. "Lights out."
Both Turner and Armstrong believed in keeping
strict training hours.</p>

<p>On this particular night the Codfish was in his
element.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for our own little quarterback,"
he howled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sit down, you fish," shouted Turner. "You
didn't even see the game."</p>

<p>"O, but I have ears. All the little birds sang
it as I was coming up from the boathouse this
evening."</p>

<p>"How's the Freshman crew coming on?"</p>

<p>"I'm on the second now. You should have
seen us scare the First boat this afternoon. Had
a mile spin. Started up by the Quinnipiac
bridge, and finished at Tomlinson, points you
land-lubbers know nothing about."</p>

<p>"And the Second was licked, of course?"</p>

<p>"Only by a blade, my son. We gave them the
race of their lives, fairly tore down the river,
scared the oysters and all that sort of thing, to
say nothing of the First Freshmen."</p>

<p>"And when do they put you in the first shell?"</p>

<p>"'Nother week, about, I guess. Wouldn't be
right to the other fellow to advance me too fast."</p>

<p>"Great stuff, Codfish," said Turner, laughing.
"I think you have confidence enough to steer the
'Varsity crew over the course at New London
right now."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said that worthy. "There's
nothing to it. Mind over matter, as I hinted to
you once before; kind of scientific attitude."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
The Codfish was busy untying a voluminous box
which he had brought home with him.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, what have you got there, a
prehistoric horse?" inquired Turner.</p>

<p>"No, my little halfback, it is a guitar," and
having finished unwrapping the instrument, he
swung it over his head. "I'm going out for the
musical club stuff. I must have some activity,
some life; can't get it with two grumps like you
fellows, so I must go after it."</p>

<p>"Jove," groaned Frank, "haven't we suffered
enough with you and the piano without
having a guitar?"</p>

<p>The Codfish lay back on the window seat,
strummed the untuned guitar, and began to hum:</p>

<p class="poem">"When I was a student at Cadiz<br />
I played on the Spanish guitar&mdash;"
</p>

<p>"You'll be a student in Hades if you don't let
up!" shouted Turner. "We can stand anything
excepting the picture of you as a student at
Cadiz. Please desist."</p>

<p>"O, tush, old fellow, your soul is not attuned
to music. What's the next line? I seem to disremember
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="fp">
"When I was a stoogent at Cadiz." strum, strum,
strum, strum,<br />
"I played on the Spanish guitar."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Good night!" yelled Frank. "Come on, let's
go to Poli's and hear some real music. We'll let
the Codfish be 'a stoogent at Cadiz' all to himself."</p>

<p>"S'matter?" said the musician reproachfully.
"Well, if you must go, good night. I cannot
frivol my time away at Poli's vaudeville when
true art is stirring in my soul."</p>

<p>"Let her stir then," said Frank. "We're off,"
and the door banged.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI. <span class="subtit">THE GREAT FRESHMAN BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>The week of the Princeton game was a hard
one for the Freshman team. Coach Howard, assisted
by several members of the 'Varsity coaching
staff, drove the team with all his might, but
the results were not encouraging. Frank had
been established as quarterback on the second
team on the Monday following the Pawling
game, and was making good there. He was now
a substitute to Madden, and twice had been
called over to the first eleven when Madden went
out of the game temporarily. Away back in his
head was the hope that he might still win out in
the race for the quarterback position. But Madden
had come to Yale with a big reputation justly
earned at Hill School, and was a hard man to displace.
When Frank's hopes were highest the
crash came.</p>

<p>Bostwick, the captain and end, threw out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
knee in a fierce scrimmage, and was carried
groaning to the side-lines.</p>

<p>"The fifth end hurt this fall, confound the
luck," said Howard as he stood looking down at
the captain. "And no one to take your place
that's worth a cent."</p>

<p>"I'll be all right in a day or two," moaned
Bostwick. "Stick some one in till I get a brace
on this thing. I can play in the game Saturday."</p>

<p>"Maybe you can and maybe you can't," said
the coach. "Did you ever see such beastly luck,
and we were just beginning to round into shape.
Who am I going to put in there? There's half
a dozen ends and none of them worth a tinker."</p>

<p>He ran his eye over the squad which crowded
around the injured captain. "Here, Armstrong,"
he called, "did you ever play end?"</p>

<p>"A few times in prep. school, sir."</p>

<p>"Well you can learn it, can't you?" said Howard
petulantly. "Bostwick may pull through in
time, and maybe he can't, and you are better than
anything I have."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," said Frank, feeling his hopes
for a place on the team slipping away, for he
knew well that in the short time still left in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
season his chances were small to learn that most
difficult of line positions&mdash;end.</p>

<p>"You are fast and about the only clean tackler
I have on the squad," said Howard. "Get in and
try it."</p>

<p>Bostwick, having been temporarily fixed up
and led limping away in the arms of two of the
substitutes in the direction of the car, play was
resumed with Armstrong in his new position.</p>

<p>"Don't you let anyone get past you on the outside,"
commanded Howard. "And don't be
drawn in, no matter what happens. If you can't
break the interference, spill it so the defensive
half can get the man with the ball. Come on,
try it."</p>

<p>Frank did try and tried hard. His ankle had
improved, and under the punts he went down
the field like a streak of lightning, missing but
few tackles. But when the team was on the defensive,
he showed the weakness of inexperience.</p>

<p>"Outside of you that time," bawled the coach,
and when the new end moved out further, the
play went inside. Sometimes he stopped the interference
and sometimes, digging desperately
through the tangle of legs, he got the runner on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a driving tackle, which earned for him a "Good
boy, Armstrong," from Howard.</p>

<p>But it was bitter hard work, and never in his
life had the welcome "That's enough for to-day"
found him so ready to quit. His body felt
bruised and sore all over from the driving work
of the afternoon and his legs were as heavy as
lead, as in the gathering dusk he dragged himself
to the waiting trolley car which was there to
carry the team to the city.</p>

<p>"You did well to-day, Armstrong, for a
starter," said the coach kindly as he came
through the car. "It's a hard dose I've given
you."</p>

<p>Frank smiled a wan smile as he loosened his
shoe laces.</p>

<p>"How heavy are you?"</p>

<p>"Guess about a hundred and forty-one or
two," said Frank, straightening up while the
muscles of his back protested.</p>

<p>"Too light, too light," said the coach, shaking
his head. "If you had another ten or fifteen
pounds on you, you'd do. But Bostwick may be
able to get into the game by Friday," he added,
and passed along to his seat.</p>

<p>Walking over from the training table that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
night, Turner railed bitterly at Frank's luck.
"You had a chance, a bare chance to get in at
quarterback for a part of the game anyway, in
spite of your bad start, and now you are dished,
sure as shooting. The Captain will be O. K.
It didn't look like a bad injury to his knee."</p>

<p>"Can't be helped," said Frank. "We've got to
take our medicine in this old game. That's part
of the training at Yale, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is, but it's not easy stuff to swallow."</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing to do but swallow it,
and I'm going to be game, but it hurts. Bostwick
may not make it, and I may get in against
Princeton, after all."</p>

<p>Turner shook his head. "I don't think there's
a chance; you are only filling in. I can see the
handwriting on the wall. He'll come back, and
you will be his substitute. The only chance is
that he may get hurt again, but I hope he won't
for he is the best we've got on that side of the
line."</p>

<p>"I hope he comes back," said Frank fervently,
"because with me in there I wouldn't give three
cents for our chances."</p>

<p>"Which are not any too good with the best
we have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>It proved to be as Jimmy said. Bostwick was
put under heroic treatment in the baking oven
for sprained and injured limbs, and to the great
joy of all, Frank included, appeared on the field
on Thursday. He was a little stiff because of the
hampering action of the brace that Howard had
devised for him, but went to his old place in the
line while Frank was sent to the side-lines.</p>

<p>The practice went well. "We still have a
chance against the Tiger cubs," said the coach.
"Only a signal drill for fifteen minutes to-morrow,"
he called out as the squad was leaving the
field. "Get to bed early and don't worry yourselves
to death. We're going to give them the
time of their lives Saturday."</p>

<p>The cheerfulness of the coach was largely assumed,
for the Princeton cubs were coming up
from Tigertown with a long string of victories
to their credit. Only twice during the whole
season had they been scored on, and one of these
was a lucky drop-kick. The Yale Freshman
team, on the contrary, had staggered through
the season with a showing far from creditable,
and the critics were all predicting a big score for
the visitors.</p>

<p>But in spite of the gloomy forecastings, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Yale Freshmen went into that game with a determination
to do or die, and while they did not
win, neither did the much-heralded Princeton
cubs win. Frank watched from the side-lines the
desperate battle up and down the gridiron. He
saw his roommate giving the best that was in
him in the struggle, and prayed fervently that
Bostwick might last it out. Every man on the
team was a hero that day, and when the final
whistle blew, with Captain Bostwick still on his
feet and playing a whirlwind game in spite of his
injured knee, the score stood at a tie, nothing to
nothing.</p>

<p>Going in on the car the coach had nothing but
praise for the team. "We didn't lick them, but
it is a good start for Harvard next Saturday,"
he said. "We have a week left, and we'll give
the Johnnies a run for their money, all right."</p>

<p>"Armstrong," the coach added, as he dropped
down beside him in the trolley car, "I'm sorry
you didn't get in, but better luck next time."</p>

<p>"O, that's all right," returned Frank. "I was
mighty glad to see Bostwick go through, he
showed his sand with that bad knee."</p>

<p>"He certainly did, and he deserves a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
credit. But I'm going to keep you at end just
the same because I may need you."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said Frank, but he well knew
it was the end of his ambitions for a place on
the team excepting for an accident to the Captain,
which he did not want to think about.</p>

<p>Four days of practice the week after the
Princeton contest brought the team to a condition
of fitness which they had not before reached
that year, and on Friday afternoon, escorted to
the train by a hundred of their class, the team
with substitutes, coaches, trainers and a goodly
crowd of supporters, set out for Cambridge. As
the 'Varsity was away, the Freshman game had
the honor of being staged on the main gridiron.</p>

<p>That game in the towering Stadium was one
that hung long in Frank's memory. It was a
game of desperate attack and defense. Three
times in the first period the rushing red-legged
players had the Blue team down inside the five-yard
line, and three times they were stopped by
the stone-wall defense. All through the first half
the Yale team fought on the defensive, crumpling
up before the fierce rushes of the Harvard
players, but somehow stiffening as the goal line
approached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>So certain were the Harvard players of scoring
a touchdown that they disdained to try for
a goal from the field, and each time they were
stopped by the men from New Haven they took
the ball back with dogged determination, only
to lose it again.</p>

<p>"We have them now," said Howard as his
men were being cared for between the halves.
"Go after them. They've shot their bolt, and
it's our turn."</p>

<p>After the kick-off in the third quarter, Turner
raised great hopes by running the ball back
through the Harvard team, and, before he was
tackled, laid it only twenty yards away from the
Harvard goal line.</p>

<p>A smash at center earned only two yards.</p>

<p>"Armstrong, get ready, I'm going to send you
in to try for a goal," said the coach, running
down to where Frank was sitting, shivering with
the excitement of the struggle that was going
on out in the field. Frank slipped off his sweater,
and made ready, but the chance he so longed for
never came.</p>

<p>Madden's signal was mixed somehow, and the
man who was to take the ball wasn't where the
quarter expected him to be. He started to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
with the ball himself, but was upset by a savage
tackle, and dropped the pigskin, which went
bounding backward toward his own goal. Half
a dozen players took a driving shot at the leather,
but it eluded them as if it had been greased.
Finally a lanky Harvard end wound his body
around it at midfield. Yale's chance to score
at that particular moment was lost.</p>

<p>Frank gritted his teeth and slipped on his
sweater again. The battle was once more taken
up with renewed vigor. The advantage lay first
with one team and then with the other, but never
again did Yale have so good a chance to score.</p>

<p>Again striking its stride, after a lot of futile
punting, the Yale Freshmen got together and
began to plough through their opponents. Turner
was playing like a demon while the little Yale
contingent matched yell for yell with the Harvard
supporters on the other side of the field.
Turner on two tries reeled off twenty-five yards,
and put the ball just across the center of the
field. A forward pass netted fifteen yards more,
and again the coach began to look for a chance to
score, not for a touchdown, for the attack had not
shown itself capable of beating down that splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
defense, but by a drop-kick if the opportunity
came.</p>

<p>But again when hope was high in every heart
came a sudden disastrous fumble, and again the
red-legged end had the ball.</p>

<p>"Take it away from them," howled the Yale
crowd.</p>

<p>"Throw 'em back."</p>

<p>"Eat the Johnnies up."</p>

<p>But that husky Harvard team was not a whit
disturbed by the ferocious cries from the Yale
side of the field. They settled down to business
again, and slowly, but surely, worked the ball
down toward the Blue goal line.</p>

<p>The tired boys from New Haven fought on
grimly in the fourth period, making the gains
against them shorter and shorter as they were
pushed back. Turner intercepted a forward pass
which would have surely made a touchdown for
Harvard, and for a time there was a respite for
the Yale Freshmen for the fullback kicked the
ball far down the field, only to have it caught and
brought back past Bostwick, this time, for thirty
yards.</p>

<p>At it again went the two teams, Yale defending
stubbornly, but vainly, against the powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
rushes of the Harvard backs, who, now that the
end of the game was drawing near, threw their
last bit of energy into the attack. Through center
and tackle went the bull-like rushes of the
backs. Bostwick's end was circled for fifteen
yards, and he was laid out for a while, but revived
soon after a little dabbing of the sponge
on his face.</p>

<p>"I want you to be ready, Armstrong," said
the coach, hurrying up to Frank whose eyes were
glued on the field, and whose heart was pumping
with the excitement of the struggle. He was
straining almost as hard as his mates out on the
field, lunging his shoulder into the substitute who
sat next to him, in the unconscious effort to help
stop the Harvard rushes.</p>

<p>"Touchdown, touchdown," sang out the Harvard
Freshmen supporters.</p>

<p>"We want a touchdown!"</p>

<p>"Hold 'em!"</p>

<p>"Hold 'em, Yale!" was the defiant cry from
the opposite side of the field.</p>

<p>"Show the Johnnies where you come from!"</p>

<p>With the ball on the Yale ten-yard line it looked
as if no power in the Yale team, at least, could
stop the victorious march. Bostwick was again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
laid out, but was up on his feet after a minute of
attention.</p>

<p>"Good old Bostwick," cried Frank, stirred by
the game fight his captain was making.</p>

<p>"Long cheer for Bostwick!" and the dancing
cheer leaders led a ringing yell for the fighting
captain, which seemed to stiffen up the boys out
on the field. They stopped the next Harvard
rush without a yard of gain. Standing like
heroes together, the Freshmen line did the impossible,
repulsed the fierce assaults the Harvard
team could give, and took the ball.</p>

<p>"Y-a-a-y&mdash;&mdash;" yelled the Yale stand, rising
as one man. Hats and caps went into the air.
The cheer leaders tried to get order, and give a
cheer, but no one paid any attention to them.
The crowd continued to yell like Comanches, as
the lines settled themselves again.</p>

<p>"Time must be nearly up," said a substitute.</p>

<p>"It can't be," cried Frank, gritting his teeth
in a frenzy. "They must have five minutes more
to play. They've got to have it," and he drove
his heels into the unoffending ground as if at
that distance he could help in the charge that
was to be delivered against the red host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's Madden going to do, rush it?" inquired
a voice.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Howard. "A short kick
would mean a free catch and a chance for a
placement goal. Good boy," he shouted as Madden
changed the signal, and the fullback, who
had gone back behind the goal line, came running
up again to the regular formation.</p>

<p>"Put it through them!"</p>

<p>"Smash it out, boys!"</p>

<p>The signal came sharp and clear from the lips
of the quarterback, high above the background
of yells from the partisans.</p>

<p>"Turner's ball," whispered Frank to himself.</p>

<p>The pass was swift and true. Turner took the
ball from Madden's hands at full speed. The
play was intended to be a slice off tackle, a play
that had gained a good deal of ground during
the afternoon. But, alas for the best laid plans
of men, mice and football players, he never
reached his destination. The tired Yale line
sagged and broke. Through gaping holes poured
a stream of Crimson-jerseyed men. Two tacklers
struck Turner, who was practically on his
goal line, at the same time, and swept him backward
like chaff. So swift and sudden had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the deluge that the halfback was carried off his
feet and over the goal line before he had even a
chance to yell "down."</p>

<p>The crowd did not at once appreciate the significance
of the matter, but a few, recognizing a
safety for Harvard, set up a scattered cheer. A
moment later the fateful information was flashed
from the scoreboard, "Safety," and the Harvard
stand delivered itself of a high-pitched yell.</p>

<p>A moment later the referee's whistle blew, and
the great game was over. A host of men swept
from the stands and surrounded the victors,
cheering and prancing about.</p>

<p>With Bostwick at its head, trying hard not to
limp, and with faces drawn and mud-stained, the
beaten team walked wearily to the dressing rooms
where they were joined by the substitutes.</p>

<p>"You didn't win but I'm proud of you all,"
said Coach Howard, slapping the jaded players
on the back as they came through the door. "You
were up against a better team, fifty per cent.
better."</p>

<p>"Here, Bostwick," he added a minute later to
the captain, who, sunk in gloom and with hanging
head, was pulling off his wet football clothes,
"cheer up. We can't always win. The main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
business is that you and your team played a
magnificent up-hill game. I'm satisfied and Yale
will be satisfied for you gave the best in you.
That's always the test. You'll have another
chance next year."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. <span class="subtit">A WRECK AT THE HARBOR.</span></h2>

<p>The excitement of football had passed like
most things in college and out of it. The 'Varsity
had triumphed over Princeton, and tied with
Harvard in a stirring, up-hill game, and now
the students had settled down to the ordinary
routine. While it was late in November, the
fall had been such an open one that the crews,
eager to get every day of practice possible, stuck
to their work in the harbor. Codfish held manfully
onto the job of coxswain in the Second
Freshmen eight, the long-looked-for place on the
First still eluding him. He was hopeful, however.
"I'll get it before the rowing stops, and if
not then, when it starts in the spring," he boasted
to his roommates. "Watch me."</p>

<p>This afternoon he was perched on the window
seat, legs crossed, lolling back on the cushions,
and tickling the guitar.</p>

<p>"For the love of Mike," cried Frank from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
room, where he had gone to nab an elusive French
irregular or two, "isn't that 'stoogent from
Cadiz' ever going to graduate?"</p>

<p>"Why so peevish?" inquired the Codfish, keeping
up his strumming and humming. "There
are fourteen different keys, you know, Mr. Armstrong,
and as you never know which one you're
going to be caught in, I've got to be a Spanish
student in every one of them. I only have ten
more to fix in my retentive memory, so the agony
will soon be through."</p>

<p>"How many have you circumvented?"</p>

<p>"Six to date. I'm going to tackle the minors
to-night; plaintive little things, those minors,
they get the heart-throb stuff."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" said Frank. "Why don't you hire
a hall somewhere out in Hampden? I'll go halves
with you to get rid of you."</p>

<p>"'Music hath charms to soothe the savage
beast,'" quoted the Codfish, "but not the football
player."</p>

<p>"Music did you say?" growled Frank.</p>

<p>"No soul, no soul at all for the beautiful,"
sighed the guitar player. "Such music ought to
move you to tears."</p>

<p>"It does, bitter tears, very bitter tears. Please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
desist, stop and quit. I'm having trouble with
this dose of Romance language. I wonder why
they ever called them Romance languages?"</p>

<p>"Give it up." Then, throwing down the guitar:
"I say, Frank, chuck it and come down to the
harbor. We are going to have a bit of a brush
with the First Freshmen crew, and you've never
seen your old pal hold the tiller ropes. Maybe
I can get you into the launch. We go out at
three. Where's Turner and David?"</p>

<p>"David is probably grubbing on his Lit. stuff,
and there's no use in trying to get him. Jimmy
went over to Chapel street to get something, and
ought to be back here in a minute. Here he
comes now. I'll go if he does."</p>

<p>Turner came into the room whistling a merry
tune, threw himself on the couch and elevated his
heels to the end of the desk in the national attitude.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, but it's a great day! Why don't
you fellows get out? Not many more days like
this between now and next May."</p>

<p>"The Codfish has just invited us down to the
harbor to see how well he can't steer a boat, and
I said I'd go if you would. I've some French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
here, but there's no hope of doing it when this
musical bug is doing his stunts."</p>

<p>"I'm your man," said Turner, jumping up at
once. "I know the coach and maybe we can
get on the launch."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to that," said the Codfish, majestically.
"I haven't been knocking around that old
boathouse two months for my health. You are
my guests to-day."</p>

<p>"Go it, old skate. So long as we get aboard
we don't mind who does the trick."</p>

<p>"Lead on, Macduff," quoted Frank, and like
playful dogs newly unleashed, they broke for the
street. Racing over to Chapel street, they
caught a steamboat car at the York street corner,
and, after a fifteen-minute ride, reached their
destination.</p>

<p>On the float was a scene of great activity. The
crews of half a dozen boats were standing around
waiting their turn to embark. Some carried oars
in their hands, others were stretched at full
length on the runways, taking in to the full the
rays of the warming late fall sun. Most of them
were stripped to the waist as in summer, for the
day had an uncommon warmth. One crew had
just landed, evidently from a smart row, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sweat glistened on their bare and brawny backs,
as they unshipped their oars and at the word of
their coxswain snapped their shell out of the
water and turned it upside down over their heads
in one splendid free sweep.</p>

<p>They were just in time to see the 'Varsity go
out, eight clean-limbed, stalwart young fellows,
who carried their shell easily, with a quick and
springy step, and with almost military precision.
Without a word spoken, the long sweeps were
quickly adjusted in the row-locks. At a word
from the captain, the men stepped to their seats,
bent and fastened their feet into the sandal-like
attachments at the footboards. Then the boat
was shoved off until the long sweeps were free to
catch the water on both sides of the boat.</p>

<p>"Row," snapped the coxswain, and eight blades
cut the water like knives, sending up a little
spurt of water in the front of each one of them.
Like a machine the bodies swung back and forth,
the blades dipped rhythmically, and in a minute
the crew was but a dot in the waters of the lower
river where the 'Varsity launch, the "Elihu
Yale," waited.</p>

<p>"By Jove," said Frank, admiration showing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
his face, "that was about as pretty a thing as
I can imagine."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you had gone out for the
crew?" inquired Turner. "They don't twist your
ankles and knees down here, or muscle-bruise
you."</p>

<p>"No, but they break your back and freeze you
to death in the cold winds down here," said someone
laughingly. "I just heard your friend's remark,
and thought I'd enlighten you. Don't you
remember me, Turner? We wrestled this fall one
night, about a thousand years ago. Francis is
my name."</p>

<p>Both then recognized the wrestler whom Turner
threw over his head the night of the rush.
He extended a frank hand. "Coming down to
look us over?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know you rowed," said Turner, taking
the proffered hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm trying it. Not much good, either,
but maybe I can help to push some other fellow
up a peg higher. That's all we scrubs are good
for, you know." He said it without any heat,
merely stating the fact. "We help to cultivate the
flowers, but we can't pick them. It's a part of
the Yale training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ta, ta, there's my call," and he dashed into
the boathouse where his crew were preparing to
take the shell out.</p>

<p>Following the Second 'Varsity, came the First
Freshmen crew, and then on the heels of the
First came the Second, the Codfish busying himself
with an air of great importance.</p>

<p>Permission having been given Armstrong and
Turner to watch the practice from the Freshman
launch, which lay at the end of the float, they
climbed in with alacrity. The launch preceded
the two crews down to the bridge where it waited
till the shell came up.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, now," said the Freshman coach
as the crews lined up alongside. "Keep your
stroke to about twenty-six and pull it through.
Ready? ROW!"</p>

<p>Both crews dropped their blades in the water,
pulled a long, slow stroke, and slipped rapidly
up the river, the little launch darting first to one
and then the other while the coach shot words
of criticism at the oarsmen through a short megaphone.</p>

<p>"Number Five, don't slump down on the
catch!"</p>

<p>"You're very short in the water, Number Two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
finish it out and get your hands away quickly."</p>

<p>"Don't buck your oar, Four, on the finish; sit
up straight."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," this to the Codfish.
"Can't you keep that boat straight? What are
you wabbling all over the river for?"</p>

<p>"'Vast, 'vast," he yelled as the rowing grew
ragged. "'Vast" is short for "Avast," the usual
signal to stop rowing.</p>

<p>When the crews came to rest on their oars,
the coach shot a torrent of criticism at the men.
No one escaped.</p>

<p>"Exactly like football," said Frank grinning.
"No one ever gets it quite right."</p>

<p>"Only difference from football is," said Jimmy,
"that the other fellow is getting the hot shot
now. I guess I'll take mine on the field."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Frank. "It doesn't strike me
as inspiring, this crew business."</p>

<p>"And the Codfish isn't such a whirlwind as he
tries to make us think," commented Turner.</p>

<p>The coxswain was coming in for a fire of
criticism from the coach with the megaphone.
"Now try it again and watch yourselves&mdash;you
get worse every day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doesn't it sound natural?" laughed Frank.
"No more of that in ours for a year."</p>

<p>The crews, stopping and starting, but always
under a shower of advice from the coach, drove
their way up to the upper bridge where they were
ordered to turn around and line-up for the race
down stream. After much dogged paddling by
fours and high-pitched orders by the coxswains,
for the boats were difficult to swing around in the
swift running current, they finally got about and
were sent off with a word from the coach who
had previously ordered them to keep below
twenty-eight to the minute.</p>

<p>Down the river the boats flew, each crew striving
with might and main. For a little time it was
nip and tuck, but by degrees the First crew edged
ahead, and half a mile from the start had a lead
of three-quarters of a length and were rowing
easily, while the winded Second was splashing
along and dropping further back at every stroke.
The Codfish was steering a serpentine course
which further retarded his boat.</p>

<p>When the crews drew up at the end of the mile,
both badly pumped out from the sprint, the coxswain
of the Second came in for a raking by
the coach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wabbled down that course like a drunken
man," he said hotly. "You ought to be on an
oyster boat. What's the matter with you? Can't
you see?"</p>

<p>"Poor Gleason, he's getting his this afternoon,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>For another hour the crews were kept on the
jump and then, as the dusk was beginning to
come down over the hills, the coach ordered them
in.</p>

<p>"Race it for the float," he commanded, "and
look out for the sand bar by the bridge. It's low
water. GO!"</p>

<p>The Second was lying about a length ahead of
the First boat when the order was given, and,
seeing his opportunity, the Codfish shouted:
"Now we've got them, beat 'em to it. Row, you
terriers!"</p>

<p>Throwing what science they had learned to the
winds, the Second Freshman crew drove their
oars into the water and, at a stroke far above
what the coach wanted, tore off for the boathouse,
the shell swaying and the water flying
while the Codfish urged them on at the top of
his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sock it through, you huskies, don't let them
get you!"</p>

<p>The First crew, not to be outdone, started after
the Second. At first they kept the stroke down,
but the coxswain, seeing his chance of overhauling
the renegades in the short distance to go,
called on his stroke to "hit it up," which that individual
was nothing loath to do.</p>

<p>"Cut them out before they get to the float,"
cried the coxswain of the First crew. Up went
the stroke, and the race was on in earnest. The
coaching launch had drifted down toward the
bridge on the outgoing tide, before the coach
saw what was in progress. He waved his arms,
bawled through the megaphone, and gesticulated
in an endeavor to stop the wild pace, but neither
crew heard, nor wanted to stop if they had heard.
This was not a race under instructions. It was
only a private scrap and, as such, it stood, for
the launch was too far off to overhaul the flying,
splashing crews.</p>

<p>Foot by foot the First crew gained on the Second,
which now, with the stroke over forty to
the minute, merely stabbed their oars in the water
and jerked them out again, while the spray flew
from each assault of the blades. The better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
trained First crew kept the stroke longer, and in
coming to the float were only a few yards behind.
Edging in, they crowded the Second from
their course, and in order to avoid a collision, the
luckless Codfish steered his crew widely to the
left. He knew, but had forgotten in the excitement
of the race, that a narrow sand bar almost
awash at low tide, was just below the central
pier of the drawbridge.</p>

<p>"Look out there, Second crew," came the warning
cry from the float now directly opposite the
racing shells.</p>

<p>The coxswain in the Second heard, but it was
too late. Straight onto the sand bar, on which
rippled less than an inch of water, ran the slender
nose of the shell. The brake thus suddenly applied
to the frail craft checked the speed, and
when the boat stuck midway of the bar, with
each end suspended above deep water, every oarsman
was thrown from his seat.</p>

<p>Immediately an ominous cracking was heard,
and the front end began to sag with its load of
more than five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>"Jump," yelled the captain, who rowed the bow
oar; but before any of the forward four could
free themselves from their foot harness, the slender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
boat snapped squarely in the middle, where
it rested on the bar, and both pieces, with their
crews aboard, slipped off into deep water, filled
and sank.</p>

<p>For a moment it looked serious, but, fortunately,
every member of the Second, with the exception
of the Codfish, could swim. As they
found themselves deeply immersed, they shook
themselves free from their foot fastenings and
struck out in the cold water for the float only a
few rods distant, all excepting the Codfish. He
kept his seat in the shell and held to the tiller
ropes for dear life, while the current swept him
down stream in the path of the oncoming launch.</p>

<p>As the rear end of the broken shell swung
across the bow of the launch, the coach reached
down, grabbed the ill-fated coxswain by the back
of his coat, and jerked him into the launch.
Then with a boat-hook both ends of the ruined
craft were captured, for both ends, released from
their weight, now floated buoyantly, and were
towed to the float.</p>

<p>"I forgot about the sand bar," said the Codfish
meekly, as he stood on the cockpit of the
launch, the water running from him in streams.</p>

<p>"And you forgot my instructions, too," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the coach, his eyes blazing at the luckless coxswain.
"This will do for you. Pack up your
duds and don't come down here again. If I see
you around this float again, I'll chuck you overboard."
The bedraggled oarsmen had all made
the float in safety, and enjoyed the discomfort of
their coxswain who in his zeal had inadvertently
given them a cold bath.</p>

<p>"How was I to remember the blooming sand
bar?" complained the Codfish that night, radiant
now in dry raiment. "We were winning.
What's a sand bar in the glory of victory?"</p>

<p>"Are you going down again," inquired Frank,
"and take the chances of a ducking?"</p>

<p>"Not on your tin-type," said the ex-coxswain.
"The thing was beginning to pall on me. No diversity
in the job, no spectators to urge you on
as you have out at the field, nothing but work.
I've resigned the job."</p>

<p>"Another way for saying you're fired, eh?"
said Turner, smiling at the imperturbable roommate.</p>

<p>"Have it any way you want to, old sport. One
thing," continued the Codfish, "even if I have lost
the chance to shine in aquatics, I still have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Mandolin Club left. I'll put a dent in that by
and by."</p>

<p>And curling himself up on the couch, with the
pillows properly arranged at his back, he struck
into the Spanish Fandango, the newest addition
to his not very extended répertoire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII. <span class="subtit">FUN AT THE THEATER.</span></h2>

<p>Up the gallery of the Hyperion Theater, the
Freshman class went bouncing with a great clatter
and stamping of feet. It was the night of the
Glee Club concert, toward the end of January,
which, in the days of Frank Armstrong's Freshman
year, opened the festivities of Junior Promenade,
the great social function of Yale. The
Promenade has for generations been known as
the "Junior Prom," but it is not strictly a Junior
occasion. Seniors, and even Sophomores whose
finances are not too low to permit the purchase
of a ticket, may go, but in spite of the
fact that many of these classes do go, the Prom
is still largely a Junior affair. Around the Prom,
or ball, which brings the social gaiety to a close,
have grown in the course of years other entertainments
for the fair guests and their chaperons,
who gather in New Haven by the hundred
from the length and breadth of the land.
Of these the Glee Club concert was one where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the Freshmen in those days, for it has all been
changed since, were tolerated in the upper gallery
of the theater. They could not sit in the
pit or balcony of the house. Custom had allowed
them certain rights and their "stunts" were
looked forward to as a part of the entertainment.
The Freshmen were not supposed to interfere
with the concert itself but frequently did interfere
in spite of the restraining influence of Junior
guards who were scattered through the gallery.
But the throwing of confetti, streamers and cards
to the fair guests was tolerated and expected.
Occasionally the Freshmen overdid the thing and
not infrequently a "rough-house" of considerable
proportions held sway.</p>

<p>Frank's class was a lively one, as had been
shown on several occasions during the fall and
early winter. A number of the members had a
faculty for getting into trouble on all occasions.
Half a dozen of them had been only a few days
before up before the Freshman Committee for
attempting to break up a dance in one of the
local halls of the city, which necessitated the
rushing of a squad of police to the scene. Minor
mischief was always being done. Rumors were
rife that the Freshmen were going to perpetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
something new on the night of the Glee Club concert.
Therefore the Junior guards were more
than usually vigilant.</p>

<p>"What's that you have under your coat?" demands
a Junior as a tall Freshman appears
on the landing of the stairs with the skirts of his
raincoat bulging suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Nothing but myself," backing away.</p>

<p>"Come on, open up! What have you got?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I tell you," but the Junior lays violent
hands on him and after a moment's search
drags forth a squawking hen! She flaps herself
free from the grip of her rescuer and creates a
disturbance which brings scores up to the landing
on the double quick.</p>

<p>The hen is finally captured and carried out,
squalling tremendously at the unaccustomed
usage.</p>

<p>Other Freshmen are captured with noise-making
devices, living and mechanical, and thrown
out bodily or the objectionable instruments of
torture taken from them. But some have slipped
past even the vigilant eyes of the guards, and
are ready to carry out the Freshman part of the
entertainment as classes before them have done.</p>

<p>Inside the theater the gallery is jammed till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
it can hold no more. There is a babel of voices
through which occasionally cuts the sharp Yale
cheer, that the Freshmen now, with three months
of practice, have learned to perfection. Cheers,
howls and catcalls make that gallery a perfect
bedlam.</p>

<p>Over the gallery front, looking fearfully insecure
in their high perch, hang scores of boys
angling for the attention of the Juniors' young
ladies with a long string to which is attached a
card and perhaps a pencil. One side of the card
bears a fond message to the fair guest below, and
the other side is blank for the answer, which
the Freshman above hopes to catch in his angling.
And frequently he does. The Junior
takes it all in good part.</p>

<p>"O, lovely creature, will you be mine, will you
let me hold your lily-white hand when I'm a
Junior?" is the rather disconcerting message a
young lady in one of the boxes pulls down after
it has been dangled in front of her nose for a
minute or two by Freshman hands in the top gallery.
The Freshman above having established
communication, waits impatiently for an answer.
Presently it is written in the box below and is
pulled up eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I don't like the color of your hair."</p>

<p>"I'll dye it blue if that will help any," may be
the next message. Fifty men are angling at a
time and the lines sometimes get crossed. It is
all great fun for the girls who enter into the
spirit of the thing and are not disturbed, after
the first shock, at the ardent messages that are
swung in front of their faces.</p>

<p>Of course, every one cannot angle for love
messages in the pit because, although the front
of the gallery resembles a grape-hung garden
wall with the clustering heads, there are
several hundreds behind the first row. They
content themselves with throwing confetti
and paper streamers into the pit and boxes
until there is a jungle of it below, through
which a late-comer must literally break his
way. The floor itself is covered with confetti
and cards whereon are printed in prose and verse
amazing praises for the class in the upper gallery,
recounting what that class will do when
it becomes a Junior class two years later and
shall have the position of honor.</p>

<p>On this particular night everything went well
in the gallery until the program was half over.
Then trouble broke loose, for all legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
means for attracting attention had been exhausted.
At the moment the quartet was delivering
itself of a touching melody and quiet was
temporarily established even in the gallery. The
tenor, striving for one of his highest notes, suddenly
broke off with a violent sneeze. Some one
in the gallery had thrown a tissue paper wad of
snuff against the scenery behind the quartet.
The paper broke and the snuff, light as feathers,
permeated the air.</p>

<p>The bass singer of the quartet immediately followed
the tenor with a resounding bellow at
which the audience, not knowing the cause, burst
into roars of laughter. But soon they changed
from laughing to sneezing, for handfuls of the
snuff were now pitched over the gallery rail by
the offenders, and the coughing and sneezing became
general. No one was exempt. Dignified
chaperons, pretty girls and their escorts joined
in the chorus. The quartet retired in confusion,
holding onto their noses.</p>

<p>"Stop it, stop it!"</p>

<p>"Get out, Freshmen," yelled the guards, but
so thick was the press in the gallery that the
guards were powerless to get at the offenders.
To cap the climax, a Freshman emptied about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
bushel of fine, powderlike confetti on the heads
of the people below, while still another opened
a pillow of fine down feathers which, dropping
to the pit of the theater in a cloud, covered the
gowns of the ladies. The feathers insinuated
themselves down the necks of everyone.</p>

<p>Having worked their last indignity, two score
of the Freshmen tumbled down the gallery stairs
like a hurricane, and broke pell-mell for the
street with the guard after them. Some punches
were delivered, but most of the Freshmen escaped,
yelling, with whole skins.</p>

<p>Then the Glee Club concert went on again and
was not interrupted but once, when someone
threw a small rubber ball from the gallery which
struck the leader fairly on top of his head and
bounced twenty feet into the air to the great
amusement of the audience and the discomfort
of the leader.</p>

<p>"Some night!" observed the Codfish as the boys
reached their room in safety. "I got hit three
times in the overflow. Gee whiz, how those
feathers stick!"</p>

<p>"Were you the pillow man?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"I was that same. Have you noticed the absence
of two of our best cushions?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"My cushions," gasped Frank, "and where are
the cases?"</p>

<p>"When the storm burst I didn't have time to
get them under cover. They go to the Hyperion
management as a souvenir."</p>

<p>"More likely to the Junior scouts," suggested
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Thoughtful kid, my initials were on them,"
said Frank. "You could create trouble for someone
if you were alone on a desert island."</p>

<p>But no trouble did come out of the incident
for the great dance itself coming on the next
evening, as it did, overshadowed such minor
things as the Freshman class and its doings.</p>

<p>But the affair had one result. It was the last
time that the Glee Club concert was ever held at
the Hyperion. After that year it went to one
of the University halls where Freshmen, fishing
from the top gallery, tantalizing feathers and
tormenting snuff were not known, and where the
concert went its full length without disturbance
of any kind.</p>

<p>Frank Armstrong, while a frequent visitor at
the swimming pool, had not gone out for the
Freshman team. Football had claimed his attention
in the fall when swimming practice first began,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and although urged to join the Freshman
team by classmates, who had seen him in the
pool, he had declined.</p>

<p>"I want to have a good big deposit in the education
bank when baseball opens up," he used to
say.</p>

<p>"You're a blooming old grind," the Codfish
would retort when Frank advanced his reasons
for keeping the time free for studies. "You
aren't doing as much as I am for the class."</p>

<p>"But I'm doing as much as I can for the class
and something for myself."</p>

<p>"Selfish, selfish. Here's the Freshman swimming
team staggering along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Floundering along, you mean."</p>

<p>"Fishes flounder, and there's no fish on the
team, human or otherwise. That's the reason
they ought to have a good, able-bodied fish like
yourself, scales and all, to help 'em out."</p>

<p>But in spite of Frank's desire to keep away
from swimming, other than as a pastime, and
to keep in fair condition, he became drawn into
it unintentionally. One day, sprinting down the
length of the pool to overtake Jimmy, he attracted
the attention of Max, the swimming instructor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
who kept an eagle eye on the outlook
for promising talent.</p>

<p>"Where you learn to svim like dat?" inquired
Max as Frank pulled himself out of the water
at the end of the pool while Jimmy hung gasping
with his exertions on the edge.</p>

<p>"O, paddling around," returned Frank.</p>

<p>"Pretty good paddlin', I guess. Vhat's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Armstrong."</p>

<p>"Freshman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ever do any racing?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Here, let's see if you can svim fifty yards
fast."</p>

<p>"O, but I'm not in training."</p>

<p>"Don't make no difference about dat. Svim
up one length and back again. I see your time.
Come on, I tink you can svim fast."</p>

<p>Frank, thus urged, took a racing dive, paddled
easily to the other end of the pool, turned leisurely
and came back to the starting point.</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted the swimming instructor.
"Dirty-five seconds, dat's bad. You ought to do
it five seconds bedder!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank grinned, thinking he was nicely out of
the difficulty, for he argued with himself that
in justice to his work he could not give the time
necessary this year at least to go in for swimming.</p>

<p>But he reckoned without Max who stood
squinting at him.</p>

<p>"Now," said the instructor, "vhen you've got
your vind again I vant you to do dat over again.
Und doan loaf along so much, move dose arms
and legs a little bid faster."</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed, for he knew Frank was trying
to get out of swimming training. But Frank was
fairly caught now, and there was nothing for him
to do but to swim the distance again. He perched
on the edge of the pool end, and balanced for the
start as Burton had shown him. He took the
water as cleanly as a knife and using a graceful
but powerful crawl shot down to the further end,
turned half under water and came back with a
quickening gait until his hand touched the pool
end where Max stood with his eyes glued on the
watch.</p>

<p>"Dirty seconds," said the instructor half to
himself. And then to Frank. "Vhy didn't you
dell me dat before? I vant you to come here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
effery day and svim. Dis Freshman bunch of
mine ain't no good. You'll help? Who showed
you how to svim like dat anyway?"</p>

<p>"O, a fellow named Burton."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Burton, one of your Yale captains."</p>

<p>"O, Burton, hey? Are you de fellar Armstrong
dat svam down at Travers Island last
summer?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"Py jiminy, vhy didn't you dell me dat before?
Dat settles it. Now you got to come and help
out this Freshman bunch."</p>

<p>That was the end of Frank's resolution not
to get mixed up in athletics until the baseball
practice opened. Every day found him at the
pool, and under the careful guidance of the instructor
he improved steadily, and when the
Freshman-Sophomore relay race came off he was
selected as the man to swim the last relay for
his class. This he did so well that, although
starting with a handicap of ten feet, he beat out
his opponent by the breadth of a hand, and won
the event for the Freshmen.</p>

<p>Frank might have been induced to continue in
the swimming game, for the love of it, but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
last part of February the overpowering call for
baseball candidates caught him, and he joined the
uniformed crowd that daily haunted the cage in
the rear of the Gymnasium; and through the
afternoons, when recitations permitted, he took
his share of batting, base-running, pitching, stopping
grounders, and all that goes to the training
of a Yale baseball player.</p>

<p>He was at first enrolled among the candidates
for pitcher, but as there seemed to be a great
plenitude of pitchers, he was relegated to the
outfield, but glad to be on the squad on any position.</p>

<p>"What, our young Christy Mathewson out in
the lots! Fie upon them!" exclaimed the Codfish
when he heard.</p>

<p>"Even Napoleon had to begin," returned
Frank. "Maybe they'll back me off the field before
long. College baseball isn't school baseball,
you know."</p>

<p>With the coming of warmer weather, the
crocuses and chirp of the robin in late March,
the baseball and track men forsook the cage for
the open field, and there during the long afternoons
the candidates were put through their
paces by the different coaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Coach Thomas, who had been appointed by the
'Varsity captain to drill the Freshman nine, was
a believer in hard work and gave his pupils
plenty of it to do. Naturally, men from the
larger preparatory schools, who had come to Yale
with a reputation made in their school, had the
first call. When they made good they held their
positions. Armstrong and Turner, coming as
they did from a school not among the half dozen
prominent ones in the country, had to show their
merit by hard fighting. But the coach played no
favorites and when a player showed merit in the
practice he had due consideration.</p>

<p>Turner and Armstrong, the former as catcher
and the latter as pitcher, worked as a battery for
some of the early practice. Frank's remarkable
control stood him in good stead at first, but as
the batters improved in their hitting of straight
balls, Frank dropped behind in the race, and was
now used only occasionally for batting practice.
He was one of the half-dozen substitutes in the
outfield. Turner fell into a more fortunate situation
as catchers on the squad were scarce, and
before two weeks of practice had elapsed, was
in second place in the race for the position of
backstop on the Freshman nine.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX. <span class="subtit">A JUMP IN BASEBALL AND THE RESULT.</span></h2>

<p>The fact that the Freshman diamond lies very
close to the running track, and more particularly
that the right field foul-line impinges on the back stretch
of the track, by a peculiar circumstance
had a very important influence on the college life
of Frank Armstrong. And so do great things
turn on small incidents.</p>

<p>On a particular day in May, Freshman baseball
practice was in full swing. Frank was still
an humble outfielder with little hope of a promotion
to the pitcher's box, for three men of more
experience were ahead of him. Thomas, however,
attracted by the bearing of Frank, had
held him on the squad in spite of the fact that he
was not an exceptional fielder. He was attentive
to instructions and because of his willingness
and earnestness to do whatever was told him to
do, held his place as a substitute right fielder.</p>

<p>"In these days," the coach told him, "no pitcher
can get along without a good assortment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
curves. Your straight ball is fine, but they get
to it. You can curve the ball but you can't get it
over the plate when you do curve it."</p>

<p>"That's my trouble, but I'll learn if you'll show
me," said Frank, "that is, I'll do my best to
learn."</p>

<p>But Thomas was not a pitcher and therefore
could not show him just how to get that puzzling
break to the ball which assured a pitcher of success
with even a moderately good control. So
Frank languished in the outfield much to the
disgust of Turner and the Codfish who thought
he was being done an injustice.</p>

<p>A practice game was in progress between the
First and Second nines, and the First nine was
at bat. Frank was playing right field. Down
along the first base line came a sizzling grounder
just inside the base. An undercut to the ball
caused it, when it struck the turf, to pull off into
foul ground. At once the man on second shot
for home. Frank started at the crack of the bat,
while the batter set sail for first base with the
evident intention of making second at least on
the hit which seemed good for two easy bases.</p>

<p>Frank, who was playing closer in than he
should have been, went for the grounder with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his speed, but seeing no hope of intercepting it
by ordinary means, leaped in the air to a point
in the line of the rolling ball. His feet, as they
struck the ground, formed a barrier which the
ball struck and jumped into the air in easy reach
of his hand. He recovered his balance, seized
the ball and drove it like lightning to the plate,
catching the runner. The catcher snapped the
ball to second, completing the double.</p>

<p>It was a pretty play and brought forth hand-clapping
from the two score of bystanders who
were watching the game.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the trainer of the track
team, Johnny Black by name, was looking over
his runners as they loped around the back stretch
of the track. His eye for the moment was off
his half-milers, and was attracted by Armstrong's
leap for the rolling ball. He crossed the
track to the Freshman outfield, searching for
the mark of Frank's cleats when he left the
ground. Having found the starting point, he
searched carefully till he found the marks of his
landing, which happened to be on a bit of ground
bare of turf where the cleat marks showed
plainly. A ball whizzed past his ear, but he paid
no attention, and even the shout of the Freshman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
coach that he was in the field of play apparently
had no effect upon him. He measured the distance
of Armstrong's jump with his eye, then
stepped it deliberately.</p>

<p>"Hey, right-fielder," demanded Johnny, as
Frank, the batting side having now been retired,
trotted toward the plate, "what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Armstrong," shouted that individual over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come here, Armstrong," said the trainer in
peremptory tones.</p>

<p>Frank halted and went back to him.</p>

<p>"You look to me like a jumper. What are you
doing over here when you can jump 18 feet with
baseball clothes on?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Trying to play ball the best I know how."</p>

<p>"Any chance to make it?" said the trainer as
he walked along toward the plate while the
First team went to their places in the field.</p>

<p>"Not very good looking now," returned Frank.
"I'm sort of a seventeenth sub-pitcher and outfielder."</p>

<p>"So! I want you over at the track for a day
or two. You ought to jump a mile. Say,
Thomas," this to the coach, "let me have Armstrong
for a day or two. I'm in an awful hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
for jumpers and he ought to make one or I miss
my guess. If he doesn't turn out right, you can
have him back again. If he does, you'll never
get him!"</p>

<p>"That's right, come and take my men away
from me," grumbled Thomas. "But I can spare
him just now as he is a pitcher and I've got
three pretty good ones. Send him back here if he
doesn't make good."</p>

<p>"All the work I'll ask him to do in training
for the jump, if he has the goods, won't prevent
him from working with you if he wants to, but
I want him first."</p>

<p>"All right," said Thomas. "Armstrong, report
to Black to-morrow afternoon, and when you
have shown him how far you can't jump, come
back here for what practice you can get."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," returned Frank.</p>

<p>"Two o'clock to-morrow at the track house.
Bring a track suit with you and jumping shoes
if you have them."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be there," said Frank but he did
not relish the change. His heart was set on
baseball, and it was a great disappointment to
him to be pulled into the track work. But his
motto was to do the best that was in him without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
question, which is the starting point for success
in most things.</p>

<p>The coming of the Freshman jumper did not
create much interest on the track squad. His
jumping did not please the trainer.</p>

<p>"Your form is bad," Black told him. "In
jumping, form is everything. You may get to
twenty-one or twenty-two feet the way you are
going, but that will be the end of it. You must
get higher in the air at the take-off."</p>

<p>Frank worked hard to master the new style.
In school he had jumped naturally and without
much coaching, but felt himself that he was not
getting his greatest distance. He redoubled his
efforts but could not lengthen out beyond nineteen
feet or a little better. Then he began to fall
below that even.</p>

<p>"You're jumping like an old brindle cow," said
Black one day. "Are your legs sore?"</p>

<p>"My shins feel as if they would crack every
time I land in the pit," said Frank, feeling the
offending legs gingerly.</p>

<p>"Why in thunder didn't you tell me that before?
You can't work at the broad jump the
same as you do at football or baseball. Lay off
for a day or two and keep off your feet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest did Frank a world of good for when
he returned to the jumping pit he cleared over
twenty feet in his first trial, much to the trainer's
delight. Thereafter he was watched with the
closest attention by Black. In the spring games
which came the last week in April he won third
place in the handicap broad jump; and after a
hard fight succeeded in beating out Warrington,
the Freshman jumper who had done the best
work up to that time.</p>

<p>Two weeks later at the Princeton Freshman
meet Frank won second place with a jump of
21 feet 5 inches, and first place in the Harvard
Freshman games a week later, bettering his mark
by three inches.</p>

<p>Armstrong was ineligible, of course, for the
'Varsity meets with Princeton and Harvard, but
kept at work perfecting his form and watching
closely the work of Hotchkiss, the Junior, who
was a consistent performer around 22 feet 6
inches, and who occasionally approached 23 feet.
But as Frank daily increased his marks, the interest
of Hotchkiss waned.</p>

<p>The Intercollegiates came and went, and
Hotchkiss maintained his position as Intercollegiate
champion by winning the broad jump for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Yale at 22 feet 10 inches. But Armstrong never
ceased his efforts. A trip to Cambridge for the
finals in the Intercollegiates showed him the
styles used by the greatest collegiate jumpers,
and after returning to New Haven he put his
observations to such good effect that he cleared
22 feet 4 inches.</p>

<p>"What's the use of keeping up that old grind at
the track," said the Codfish one night. "Why
don't you go over to the Freshman baseball
squad? You may get a chance there yet."</p>

<p>"I'm after something," returned Frank, "and
it's coming so fast that I don't want to let go."</p>

<p>"And that something?"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, it's Hotchkiss. He's been so
blamed cocky that I'd give my shoes to lick his
mark in the Intercollegiates just for personal
satisfaction. I'm too late to do anything with the
baseball squad now anyway."</p>

<p>"Noble ambition," said the Codfish, "but
what's the use? There's nothing more for the
track men this spring."</p>

<p>"Just the same I'm going to keep at it."</p>

<p>"Go ahead then, jump your legs off, while
Turner and I win the glory."</p>

<p>Turner had by steady improvement worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
himself into the position of first catcher on the
Freshman team. The Codfish, leaving temporarily
his ambition to break into the exclusive ranks
of the Mandolin Club, had won the position of
official scorer of the Freshman, a place which he
filled with great credit.</p>

<p>"Another sit-down job," said Turner laughing.
"Trust the Codfish to get something easy."</p>

<p>"Why not? I don't love violent exercise. If
I hanker for the cool shade of the scorer's bench
and can record the glorious deeds of our young
catcher and ease up on him when he makes flub-dubs,
who is to say me nay? But I'm a believer
in hard work, just the same&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the other fellow," broke in Frank.</p>

<p>"Sure, that's what gives Yale her prestige,
doesn't it? If it becomes necessary for me to
don the baseball suit to uphold the athletics of
Yale, then I'll do it. Till then, with all you good
workers around, I don't see any reason why I
shouldn't take the shade."</p>

<p>"Noble youth," said Frank. "We'll keep on
in the sun and let you take the shade," and nothing
either the Codfish or Turner could say
changed Frank's determination to keep everlastingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
at his jumping practice, uninteresting
though it appeared to his roommates.</p>

<p>"Now I know why you stuck to the jumping,"
said the Codfish one morning as he scanned the
first page of the <em>News</em>.</p>

<p>"Elucidate," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Here it is right in our lively little daily. Oxford
and Cambridge-Yale-Harvard meet arranged.
Teams about evenly matched. Sail for
England July 2nd, and a whole string of likely
candidates in which I see your name."</p>

<p>"O, but I'm a Freshman, and a Freshman can't
compete in 'Varsity matches," said Frank, but his
heart gave a bound just the same.</p>

<p>"You won't be a Freshman after June 17th,
you bonehead," returned the Codfish joyfully,
"provided you don't flunk your examinations.
You'll be a jolly Sophomore with all the blackness
of Freshman year behind you."</p>

<p>"But there's Hotchkiss. He's better than I
am, and a Junior."</p>

<p>"He'll be a Senior, don't you savez, but that
will make mighty little difference if you can outjump
him. They will take only the best, or I'm
a galoot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"You generally are, Codfish, but I'll work my
head off to make that team."</p>

<p>"You've nearly worked it off already, and
you've got to make that team. Pictures in the
papers, details of your early life, moving stories
about your many virtues, weeping relatives at
the dock as the ship sails out of the bay and all
that sort of thing. I can see it all now."</p>

<p>Frank laughed at his enthusiastic friend. But
his pulse quickened at the thought of the possibility
of making the team which should represent
America in this international contest. Turner,
too, was wild with delight at the turn affairs
had taken. "Now I wish I had been a jumper.
We'll read the cable dispatches every day. You're
bound to make it."</p>

<p>"Don't count your chickens," said Frank, "till
they are safely hatched. You forget that Hotchkiss
is doing nearly 23 feet."</p>

<p>Two days later a call in the <em>News</em> brought all
the first string track men together in the trophy
room of the Gymnasium, and Frank Armstrong
was among them. Captain Harrington read the
challenge from the English Universities, and told
them what was expected of them.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a free field, and everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
will have his chance. The team will be the best
that Harvard and Yale can get together. Practice
will be held at the Field every day as usual,
and the trials will be at Cambridge a week before
we sail. Only first place counts in this meet with
the Englishmen so it will not be necessary to take
any but the best men in each event. I want you
to give the best in you. We must give a good
account of ourselves here at Yale."</p>

<p>The captain got a rousing cheer at the end of
his speech which was a long one for him, and the
athletes clattered down the wide, marble steps in
excited discussion of the coming event and Yale's
possibilities.</p>

<p>"Armstrong," said the trainer next day at the
field, "you have a chance to make this team. I
want you to go to it as hard as you know how."</p>

<p>"I've been doing that for the last month."</p>

<p>"Well, you've improved a lot in that time.
You've got to beat Hotchkiss to win out. It's up
to you."</p>

<p>During the remainder of the college year
Frank put every spare minute in the preparation
for the final test for the team. Even in the trying
time of examinations he managed to squeeze
out half hours at the Field, and when it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
possible to get out there, he studied the theory
of broad-jumping, searched the library for information
on the subject and found little enough.
At Commencement a famous jumper of former
years took him in hand and gave him some advice
which helped him greatly. Steadily, if slowly, he
continued to improve his marks, until one hot
morning he raced down the runway and cleared
22 feet 10 inches, much to the discomfort of
Hotchkiss who, in spite of his experience, did not
relish the fact that the Freshman was drawing
nearer and nearer to equality with him.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two feet ten inches," announced
Black. "Hotchkiss, you've got to look out for
your laurels. This Freshman will beat you out
if you don't improve your jump."</p>

<p>Hotchkiss scowled and tried harder than ever,
but he seemed to have reached his limit, and was
unable to surpass his distance in the Intercollegiates.</p>

<p>That night Frank wrote to his mother: "Mother,
I have a chance, only a chance, mind you, to
make the team that is going to England to represent
Yale and Harvard. If I win a place are
you and dad willing to let me go?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>And the answer came back on the next mail:
"Yes."</p>

<p>"That settles it," cried Frank, flourishing the
letter above his head as he capered about the
room. "I'll win out or die trying."</p>

<p>The Codfish spoke up: "Perhaps you don't
know that I'm going too."</p>

<p>"For what?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"To see that you keep in strict training and
out of mischief."</p>

<p>"You actually mean you would go across if I
should make the team?"</p>

<p>"Bettcher life," came the quick answer. "I've
got to do something this summer, and I can't
imagine anything better than to see the Johnny
Bulls properly tanned."</p>

<p>"Jimmy, how about you?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"I'm not a bloated bondholder like the Codfish.
It's work for mine this summer. But I'll
read all the cablegrams and pray for you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X. <span class="subtit">THE TRY-OUTS AT CAMBRIDGE.</span></h2>

<p>It was the day of the try-outs at Cambridge
when the best that Harvard and Yale could
muster were gathered to contest for a place on
the team which should meet Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>"One week more and we will be on the briny,"
observed Gleason confidently to Frank. The
speaker, Jimmy and David had all journeyed to
the big Stadium to see their classmate compete
for a place.</p>

<p>"Gleason, if you talk like that much more,
you'll hoodoo me. Don't forget that I'm a novice
at this game. I've got about one chance in ten."</p>

<p>"You'll come through all right," said David
Powers. "I've noticed that you do pretty well
under pressure."</p>

<p>"As, for instance, football on the Yale Freshman
team!&mdash;Go to, David, go to! I know what
you fellows are trying to do. You're trying to
keep up my sinking spirits. Much obliged."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was dressing for the trials along with
the point-winners of the 'Varsity track team, but
he felt strange and shy with the older and more
seasoned athletes. He was the only Freshman
who had been taken with the Yale squad, and his
three friends, David, Jimmy and the Codfish, had
made it a point to be with him.</p>

<p>"I don't see any particular reason for anyone
going over to represent us in the broad jump anyway,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>"How's that?" inquired someone.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see the morning papers? No?
Well, Vare, that Oxford man, jumped 23 feet
5 in practice, and they think over there there's
nothing but England to this coming meet. All
the prophets have it settled."</p>

<p>"I've heard of prophets slipping before now,"
said the Codfish gaily.</p>

<p>"And Vare is a consistent jumper, better than
23 feet most of the time, from all I can learn,"
went on Frank. "Cambridge has a pretty good
jumper, too, better than we have, but away behind
Vare. So if the unexpected happens and
I should win out, which doesn't look bright, I'd
be nothing but an also-ran when it comes to the
scratch over there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Out on the track where the contestants were
now hurrying, a crowd of officials and friends
were gathered along the straightaway and the
various jumping pits. Halloby had already won
his place in the high hurdles and was receiving
the congratulations of his friends as he walked
smilingly back to the track house.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Halloby," came the greeting from
all sides. A Yale man had been second. Both
would be taken.</p>

<p>Hotchkiss was at the jumping pit when Frank
reached there, and was engaged in marking with
the greatest care the length of his strides just
before the "take" of the jump so that he would
get the best results. Up and down the runway he
went, measuring and pacing. He gave Armstrong
a curt nod as he walked to the jumpers'
bench to the right of the runway.</p>

<p>Just as the quarter-mile ended, giving Harvard
two men and Yale none in this event, the broad
jumping contest was started with Hotchkiss leading
off. On his first try, Hotchkiss overran the
jumping block. McGregor, a Harvard man,
cleared 21 feet 8 inches, another Harvard man
21 feet 6, and then it came Frank's turn.</p>

<p>"Now, Armstrong," said the trainer as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
walked down the runway toward the point where
Frank had left his jersey as a starting mark.
"Keep your head, get a breeze up in those last
six strides and hit the block hard. Go ahead."</p>

<p>Frank loped down the runway for perhaps fifty
feet, speeding up toward the middle of the run.
Then within six or eight strides of the block he
burst into full speed, hit the block squarely, and
shot into the air. It looked like a magnificent
jump but when he struck in the soft sawdust and
loam of the pit he could not hold the full distance,
and fell backwards, breaking the ground
a good three feet to the rear of where his heels
first touched. Naturally, the jump was measured
from the block to the point where his hand broke
the ground.</p>

<p>"Twenty feet four inches," sang out the judge
of the event.</p>

<p>"This Yale Freshman isn't such a wonder,
after all," whispered a Harvard competitor to
another sitting next him on the bench. "If he
could have held his distance, it would have been a
peach, though."</p>

<p>"Your old fault, Armstrong," said Black coming
over to him. "That jump was actually better
than 23 feet. Now, try to stay up on your next."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>As the trainer spoke, Hotchkiss came rushing
down the runway. He got a perfect take-off, rose
in the air, turned halfway round in his flight, but
held the distance he had made on the jump, which
was a moment later announced to be 22 feet 10
inches.</p>

<p>McGregor followed with a pretty jump of 22
feet 6, while his teammate did not better his first
jump, which was not good enough even to be
measured.</p>

<p>Again it was Frank's turn, and so well did
he heed the coaching of Black that the judge
gave him credit for 22 feet 8 inches, the second
best jump of the afternoon. Hotchkiss still held
the lead, however, and swaggered a little as he
walked around. The jumpers followed each
other in rotation. Frank's next try was a failure,
but on the following one, gathering all his
energies for a supreme effort, he sailed into the
air like a bird.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two feet ten and three-fourths
inches," called the judge, showing in his voice an
awakening interest in the event.</p>

<p>Hotchkiss, stung at the thought that the Freshman
had beaten his best mark, showed very
plainly in his preparations for his trials that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
meant to wipe him out. He moved his marks a
trifle, stepped the distance carefully, and then,
seemingly satisfied, walked slowly to the end of
the runway.</p>

<p>"He's peeved," remarked Turner.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make to him anyway,
he's sure to be taken, isn't he?" inquired
David.</p>

<p>"Hotchkiss is one of those chaps who hate to
be anything but first."</p>

<p>"He has a head like a rhinocer-hoss," said the
Codfish. As he spoke, Hotchkiss turned at the
far end of the runway. Every eye was on him
now, which was not at all displeasing to him.
Down the runway he came like a race horse, his
gaze fixed steadily on the take-off block where
the supreme effort was to be made. But so great
was his speed in his endeavor to eclipse all previous
efforts that he struck the block badly,
sprang in the air, lost his direction and landed
partly in and partly out of the pit in an awkward
straddle. Unable to keep his balance he fell over
sideways on the hard ground and lay there
groaning.</p>

<p>In an instant a half score of bystanders had
run to the aid of Hotchkiss. He was picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and set upon his feet, half stunned, but when
he attempted to take a step, he sank down groaning.</p>

<p>The trainer sprang to the side of the injured
jumper. "Where is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My ankle," moaned Hotchkiss. "I twisted it
in some way. Here, let me try it again." But
try as he might, he could not bear a particle of
weight on the injured leg, and had to be carried
to the Locker Building in the arms of two of his
teammates.</p>

<p>Immediately a buzz of excited conversation
rose.</p>

<p>"That hurts our chances in England, doesn't
it?" inquired one of the officials.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. Hotchkiss was good enough to
win over the Cambridge man in case anything
should happen to the Oxford man, Vare. He
didn't have a chance to beat Vare because Hotchkiss
has never done as well as 23 feet, while Vare
is a consistent performer at several inches better."</p>

<p>"The broad jump is one of the events that
we've got to count out, then, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is now," said the trainer. "If
Armstrong had a year more of experience he'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
give the Oxonian a good battle. Armstrong is a
natural jumper, but has not perfected his form
yet. It will take another year."</p>

<p>When the excitement over the injury to Hotchkiss
had passed, the trials continued and Armstrong
created a ripple of interest when on his
last trial he came within an inch of the coveted
23-foot mark.</p>

<p>The result of the contest in the broad jump
was that Armstrong, representing Yale, and McGregor,
representing Harvard, were selected for
the team. In all, twenty-six men were chosen
that afternoon for the fourteen events to be
contested in England, fourteen from Harvard
and twelve from Yale. These men were the very
flower of both teams. In the hammer and shot
events only two from each college were selected
since the best hammer throwers were also the
best shot putters.</p>

<p>To say that it was a jubilant quartet of boys
who tumbled off the train at Milton, would be
expressing it in weak terms.</p>

<p>"Open up the cupboard," cried Frank after the
home greetings were over. "You have four
champion diners with you to-night."</p>

<p>"A little soup, slice of mutton and toast for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the athlete, Mrs. Armstrong. Frank isn't allowed
to eat anything rich, you know, training
table grub and all that."</p>

<p>"You chase yourself around the block, Mr.
Codfish. The training table has a rest for a
solid week&mdash;apple dumplings, strawberry shortcake
and all the fixings belong to me."</p>

<p>"Seems as if you had earned it, son," said
Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>"Grand little muscles, Mr. Armstrong," said
the loquacious Codfish. "Nice, hard and knotty,
warranted pure steel, made in Germany&mdash;just
feel them, best set in Yale&mdash;delivery of goods
guaranteed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The dinner gong cut the speaker's flow of language
short, but at the table he kept the conversation
moving at a lively pace.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," said Mr. Armstrong, edging into
the torrent of talk, "do you like Yale as well now
as ever?"</p>

<p>"Yale is great stuff," came the ready chorus.</p>

<p>"It would be better if we didn't have so many
studies," added the Codfish.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Well, a fellow just gets settled down to doing
something like baseball or football or track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
athletics when the recitations break in. And the
profs. get so peeved when a fellow isn't up to
form that they have an unkind habit of flunking
him."</p>

<p>"And do you flunk, Mr. Gleason?" inquired
Mrs. Armstrong.</p>

<p>"Does he flunk! O, my!" laughed Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I hold the record in the class," said the Codfish
proudly. "Four in one day. Such a successful
flunker that I have three conditions for next
year."</p>

<p>"Conditions, what are they?"</p>

<p>"O, just little attachments that they sometimes
put onto Freshmen," laughed Frank.</p>

<p>"Have you any, Frank?" inquired his father.</p>

<p>"In athletics a fellow has to keep up to the
scratch, you know. If he doesn't, he can't go
into athletics. The Codfish is the free-lance."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's gone into everything," interjected
Jimmy, "and so far hasn't won a battle."</p>

<p>"O, but he will," said Mrs. Armstrong.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your confidence," said that individual
rising and making a sweeping bow.
"'Familiarity breeds contempt,' so they say, and
my familiar roommates fail to see the outcroppings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
of genius as clearly as you do. I've nearly
won several battles already."</p>

<p>And then Jimmy gave the history of the Codfish's
unsuccessful onslaughts on the <em>News</em>, the
Crew and the Mandolin Club to the amusement
of the older members of the family.</p>

<p>"The difficulty is," said the Codfish, "that the
individual has no chance at college. It is all for
the development of the average man, like Jimmy
there, for instance. Genius is frowned upon. I
could have revolutionized the <em>News</em> if they'd
given me a little longer chance at it."</p>

<p>"Demoralized it, you mean," said Frank.
"Mother, give me another piece of that shortcake.
My, but it tastes good after so much training
table."</p>

<p>Training hours were broken that night, and
for several nights to come, for the boys played
with as much vigor as they worked. But Frank
did not neglect his physical training. Swims at
Seawall, where our friends foregathered for the
first time several years before, rowing, and walks
in the country, kept him in trim for the work
which was to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI. <span class="subtit">A VOYAGE TO LONDON.</span></h2>

<p>Ten days after the trials at Cambridge, Frank,
with the Codfish at his side, stood on the promenade
deck of the great White Star liner <em>Olympic</em>,
and waved good-by to his friends on the dock
as the big boat moved slowly out into North
River.</p>

<p>"Bring back their scalps, you Indians,"
shouted someone.</p>

<p>"Don't let the Johnny Bulls get your goats,
you Yaleses!"</p>

<p>"Show them how they do it in Yankeeland,
Harvard!"</p>

<p>To all of which the outgoing athletes, in a little
group apart from the rest of the passengers,
smiled and waved hands in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz," said the Codfish as the big ship
slipped swiftly down the bay, "I never thought
of it before, but what if I should be seasick?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't make so much difference about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
you," said Frank heartlessly, "but what if <em>I</em>
should? That's the question!"</p>

<p>Fortunately, the ocean was calm and none of
the team suffered in the slightest from the
dreaded sickness. With the first meal on the
ship the athletes were seated together, and soon
Yale and Harvard lines were forgotten. The
men from the two universities fraternized with
each other and the team was neither Harvard nor
Yale, but an American team with only one object
in view,&mdash;victory from their English cousins.</p>

<p>Training regulations were established at once,
and while the routine was not so strict as on
land, the trainers saw to it that their athletes
retired not later than 10:30 and that they were
up at 7 in the morning for a jog around the
decks before the passengers were about. The
long decks of the <em>Olympic</em> made a surprisingly
good training ground. A training stunt which
amused the passengers was dancing, not in the
ordinary sense of the word, but "standstill sprinting"
as the Codfish called it, on a cork mat, on
which the runners got practically the same leg
action as they would running on the open track.
A large cork mat was spread on the boat deck,
and relays of men, four at a time, pranced merrily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
rested and pranced again. Then came a cold
salt water shower and a rub-down. In the afternoon
the dancing exercise would be repeated.
Skipping the rope was another deck exercise
which played a large part in keeping the men in
good condition.</p>

<p>"Where do you keep yourself nowadays?"
said Frank one evening after dinner. He had
noticed that Gleason disappeared for long periods
during the day.</p>

<p>"O, just sitting about and thinking. Can't
think where you athletes are romping around.
You make more noise than a bunch of magpies.
I'm sick of athletic chatter, that so-and-so ought
to do 10 seconds, and that Mr. Blinks of Harvard
should win his half if he doesn't get too
fast a pace in the first quarter, that Mr. Jenks
of Yale is likely to pull a tendon, and so on and
so on."</p>

<p>"So you sneak off and improve your mind?"</p>

<p>"Right-O, sonny. I'm doing that same."</p>

<p>But the next day Frank discovered the cause of
the Codfish's long absences. The Codfish did not
have his meals at the athletes' table but at a
table nearby. Adjoining the table where he sat,
Fate, in the person of the steward's assistant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
had placed Mr. and Mrs. Mortimore Hasbrouck,
their daughter Marjorie and son William. Fate
went a step farther than the location of the Hasbrouck
family and undoubtedly had a hand in
the business of seating Marjorie at this table
where her bright face was in range of the Codfish's
roving eyes.</p>

<p>Now, Marjorie was fair to look upon as the
Codfish admitted to himself when she made her
appearance in the dining saloon the first night at
sea. "But she's only a kid," he said to himself,
"just fresh out of some boarding school if I dope
that pin on her shoulder right."</p>

<p>The Codfish looked and looked, but the eyes of
Marjorie were on the athletes' table beyond him,
and were not for him. Her gaze continually
traveled over his head, and now and then he
could hear the words "Harvard, Yale, track athletes&mdash;&mdash;"
for, of course, everyone knew that
the teams were aboard even before the ship left
the dock.</p>

<p>"She doesn't know I belong to the party,"
thought the Codfish, gloomily, "or she wouldn't
waste all her looks at the next table. I've got to
fix that!"</p>

<p>That night he made it a point to speak to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Billie, while the latter hung on the outskirts of
the crowd of athletes, and Billie was, of course,
overjoyed to be spoken to by a college man, for
he was only in his third year in prep. school, and
considered a collegian a kind of demigod.</p>

<p>"Are you one of the athletes?" inquired Billie.</p>

<p>"I'm one of the Yale men," said the Codfish
feeling his chest expand.</p>

<p>Billie jumped to the conclusion that he was
one of the competitors, and was duly elated at
the fortunate acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, I'm glad to know you. I'm going
down to Yale myself next year if I get through
my exams. Should have been there this year but
flub-dubbed the exams. Dad says if I don't make
it next year it's good-night for mine."</p>

<p>"Stick to it, stick to it, my boy! A college
life is a great thing,&mdash;training of the mind, associations,
mental and physical development and all
that sort of thing." As he talked he led the
way up the deck in the direction of the Hasbrouck
family chairs. The Codfish shot a look
out of his eye and observed the object of his
search, the fair Marjorie. But the expected
didn't happen. Billie, glorying in the companionship
of a Yale man and a member of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
team of athletes, led his new-found friend up and
down the deck half a dozen times to let the full
weight of its significance sink into the family.</p>

<p>Getting impatient at last, and tired of the
walking, the Codfish said: "Seems to me I've
seen you and your sister before somewhere. Perhaps
it was down at the game last fall."</p>

<p>"Wish I had been there, but nothing doing!
Just at that time I got into trouble at school and
the Pater shut down on me. Beastly luck. But,
say, Mr.&mdash; Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gleason."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleason, won't you come and meet the
family? Sis will be delighted to know a Yale
man."</p>

<p>Thus came the Codfish to the Hasbrouck family,
where, being properly presented, he bowed
low and with supreme dignity. When Marjorie
offered him her hand he held it a trifle overtime
and looked unspeakable things.</p>

<p>"What is your specialty, Mr. Gleason?" inquired
Mrs. Hasbrouck.</p>

<p>"O, a little of everything," said the Codfish
noncommittally.</p>

<p>"O, isn't that lovely," cried Marjorie. "He
does everything!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I try a few things," struggling to produce
a modest smile and with indifferent success.</p>

<p>"Tell us about Yale, Mr. Gleason," said Mrs.
Hasbrouck. "I'm so sorry John isn't here because
William is going down to Yale next year,
I hope. I went to a game there years ago,
a football game I think it was, in June&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baseball, I think," corrected Billie. "They
don't play football in June."</p>

<p>"Well, baseball then. I thought it a wonderful
place."</p>

<p>"O, it's a pretty good place," said Gleason,
and then nothing loath to talk, particularly when
Marjorie made the inquiries, he launched into a
dazzling word picture of Yale and her glories.
At the end of ten minutes he had made such
progress with Marjorie that she readily accepted
his invitation to take a promenade with him.
From that moment the affairs of the Yale-Harvard
track team, and even the more intimate concerns
of his roommate began to decline from the
zenith of his attentions. Marjorie was in the
ascendency.</p>

<p>It was on the second day out that Frank Armstrong,
noticing the Codfish's absence, had asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
him where he kept himself, and was not at all
satisfied with the answer he got. "The Codfish
sitting around, thinking! Never!" said Frank to
himself. And shortly after, Frank had ocular
demonstration as to the real trouble. He met
Codfish and Marjorie, and the former was so
much absorbed that he didn't even see his roommate.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" cried Frank. "Wait till I see him!"</p>

<p>When the Codfish turned up that night in the
stateroom, Frank pounced upon him.</p>

<p>"So you've been sitting around, thinking, have
you?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing, thinking what I'd do next. I
say, Frank, she's a pippin. Billie's an awful
bore, but his kid sister is a peach, believe me!"</p>

<p>"I thought you were an out-and-out woman-hater."</p>

<p>"I used to be in my younger days," said the
Codfish, earnestly, "but this Marjorie girl has
certainly got me going. Some eyes, boy, some
eyes."</p>

<p>"So, that's why you've been neglecting your
poor roommate, is it? I thought you came over
here to see that I had good attention and kept in
training. I might be at almost anything, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
enjoying a pipe in the smoking room with John
Hasbrouck as far as you are concerned."</p>

<p>"I guess you will be all right looking after
yourself. Now in Marjorie's case&mdash;" he had
reached the point already of calling her "Marjorie,"
and he lingered a little over the name&mdash;"in
Marjorie's case, it is different. She needs a
strong arm to lean on," and the Codfish stretched
his legs out luxuriously.</p>

<p>"And you are furnishing the arm?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And how about her father and mother and
even her brother? They have no protecting
arms, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Frank, they don't understand her. She seems
quite alone. This is in confidence, Frank,&mdash;she's
going to go on the stage as soon as she's through
school. She'd make a hit, I tell you! She has
great ambition, that girl has!"</p>

<p>"And what does her mother say about the
stage?"</p>

<p>"O, just laughs at her, has no conception of
the depths of that girl's nature. I doped her
out for myself soon as I saw her. Frank, old
chap, I love her!" At this astounding piece of
intelligence Frank howled with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, go ahead and laugh, but I tell you
this is serious. Say, Frank, you wouldn't mind
if I went on to Paris with the Hasbroucks, would
you? You won't need me for anything. I'll get
back to London for the meet maybe."</p>

<p>"You'll get lost snooping around Paris all by
yourself," said Frank as soon as he could regain
the breath that Gleason's question had knocked
out of him.</p>

<p>"O, but I'll not be alone. I'll travel with the
Hasbroucks. My heart tells me to go."</p>

<p>"Very well then," said Frank. "If you have
such an unreliable heart, there's nothing for it
but to go I suppose. You may change your mind
or your heart before we dock."</p>

<p>"Never!" said the Codfish. "This is a deep
and lasting feeling I have. It has changed the
whole course of my life. I came onto this boat
a mere boy, now I feel I'm a man with all the
responsibilities of a man."</p>

<p>Codfish's infatuation was too good a story to
keep, and Frank took McGregor, the Harvard
broad jumper, with whom he had struck up a
friendship, into his confidence. "That friend of
mine, Gleason, has a love attack and tells me he
is going to desert and go on to Paris with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
fair charmer. How are we going to head him
off?"</p>

<p>"Win his girl away from him," suggested McGregor.</p>

<p>"But he doesn't give anyone a chance," said
Frank, laughing. "He sticks around from morning
till night. He certainly has a terrible case."</p>

<p>"Get him up on the boat-deck for a game of
shuffleboard," suggested McGregor, "and then
we'll get someone to talk to Marjorie. When
that fellow gets tired, we'll have someone else
take up the relay and so on."</p>

<p>"Great," said Frank. "Let's try."</p>

<p>That afternoon, the Codfish, all unsuspecting,
was led off for a try at the popular deck game,
and in his absence one of the team, who was in
the plot, contrived to get an introduction to Marjorie,
took the vacant chair of her father, and began
a lengthy conversation. When the Codfish,
who had been detained at the game as long as
possible, hurried back to his lady-love he found
his place occupied. Back and forth he paced,
casting longing looks in the direction of the Hasbrouck
chairs, but Marjorie was deeply interested
in the young man alongside of her, and
did not even look in the Codfish's direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
After half an hour of agony, the Codfish observed
with joy that his rival was preparing to
leave, but just at that moment, up strolled another
of the athletes to the coveted chair, and being
asked to sit down, did so and continued the conversation,
while plotter No. 1 went on his way.
For two mortal hours the Codfish was held at bay,
pacing the decks and railing at his luck while
the relays continued.</p>

<p>"How in the deuce did she come to know all
these fellows?" growled the Codfish to himself.
"Next time I'll not go playing shuffleboard and
leaving her alone, so help me Bob!"</p>

<p>When finally the Codfish thought his inning
was about to come, Marjorie tripped gaily off
with the last of her suitors, and after a promenade
around the deck, disappeared somewhere
below to Gleason's great distress of mind.</p>

<p>That evening Marjorie was again carried off,
this time by the Yale half-miler, and the only
thing left for the Codfish was to occupy her vacant
chair, which he did, and proceeded to make
himself agreeable to Mrs. Hasbrouck, though his
eyes followed Marjorie on her promenade up and
down the deck.</p>

<p>"Mighty attractive girl, that Miss Hasbrouck,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
said Frank that night as the boys were preparing
to retire. "She's made a great hit with the team,
did you notice it?"</p>

<p>"Did I notice it?" cried the Codfish petulantly.
"Yes, I noticed it. Where in the name of the
Great Horn Spoon did she meet all those fellows?"</p>

<p>"Mutual attraction, I s'pose," said Frank. "I
saw you holding forth with her mother most of
the evening. Charming lady, eh?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, all right. Interested in philanthropy
and all that sort of thing. Wanted me to help
her raise something for the Widows and Orphans
Fund for Sailors; subscription papers, and
all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"And you're for it?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, Marjorie's mother you see. Couldn't
do anything else. I've got to stand in right with
her mother."</p>

<p>"Noble youth," said Frank. "First catch the
mother and the daughter will come easy. Is that
it?"</p>

<p>"You have a glimmer of intelligence, Armstrong,
a rare thing in your case."</p>

<p>"We have him on the run," said McGregor the
next morning at breakfast. "I suggest a round-robin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
letter to the young lady. How would this
suit?" He hauled a letter from his pocket and
handed it to Frank, who read it while a smile
stole over his face.</p>

<p>"Will she take it all right, do you think?" said
Frank as he handed the letter back to the conspirator.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. The Codfish cuts no figure now
since she's had a taste of bigger game. I'll write
it out and get everyone to sign it."</p>

<p>"Go to it," said Frank. "We must save our little
Codfish."</p>

<p>That afternoon while Miss Hasbrouck was
curled up in her deck chair with the Codfish in
attendance, a deck steward handed a letter to her.
A long list of signatures followed.</p>

<p>"A wireless?" inquired the Codfish, much interested.</p>

<p>"Too funny for anything," said the girl. "I
wonder if I had better let you read it? It concerns
you."</p>

<p>"Me?" said the Codfish in astonishment, reaching
out for the letter.</p>

<p>"Promise not to get mad if I let you see it?"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart, hope to die if I do."</p>

<p>"All right, then, but remember your promise."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
She passed the letter over to him, and this is
what he read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="fp">"Dear Miss Hasbrouck:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have observed with growing anxiety the
attention which one of our party has been paying
to you. While we do not wish to alarm you,
we feel you ought to know that this young man
is afflicted with mental aberration. In other
words, he is slightly off his head. As far as we
know he has never had a dangerous spell, but you
can never tell. Please pardon us for seeming to
intrude, but we thought you ought to know."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then followed a long list of signatures of
practically every man on either team.</p>

<p>Gleason was just finishing the perusal of the
note when McGregor pranced up to Miss Hasbrouck.
"Take a walk around the deck?" he
queried, and that young lady hastily jumped up
without even excusing herself to the Codfish, and
started off at a brisk pace with the young Harvard
man.</p>

<p>"Nutty, am I?" said the Codfish. "I'll show
them," gritting his teeth, "I'll show them.
They're trying to queer me," and then to Mrs.
Hasbrouck who had just come up from her stateroom:
"O, Mrs. Hasbrouck, I'm going to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
you with that fund. Guess pretty nearly everyone
of the two teams will subscribe to it."</p>

<p>"That's very sweet of you, indeed. It is a
noble thing to do to help such a good cause to
provide for the widows and orphans of the sailors
who go down in the great deep."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said the Codfish, enthusiastically.
"All our fellows are very generous on such a
thing as that. I never saw such a noble bunch
of fellows as we have with us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hasbrouck beamed over her spectacles.
"I think we ought to collect as much of the fund
as we can to-day; only a little more of our sea
voyage is left, you know."</p>

<p>"'A bird in the hand is said to be worth two
in the bushes!'" returned the Codfish. "I'll be
back in a minute," he added. On the way down
to the bulletin board in the companionway where
were inscribed the signatures of those who were
willing to help along the fund with contributions,
he came upon Marjorie and McGregor,
their heads together in deep conversation.
Neither saw him or they pretended not to see him
as he passed, and the fires of revenge burned the
deeper in his heart. Five minutes later he was
back at Mrs. Hasbrouck's chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"The names of pretty nearly every one of our
fellows are down under that subscription paper,"
he informed her. "I've made a copy of them
all and the amounts opposite each name."</p>

<p>"This is wonderful," said Mrs. Hasbrouck, enthusiastically
as she ran through the list. "Mr.
McGregor $25; Mr. Armstrong $25; Mr. Wallace
$10; Mr. Burrows $10; why, this is really
wonderful. You will certainly get your reward
for your kindness. I'll call the steward's attention
to this, and suggest that he ought to collect
to-day, for to-morrow will be our last day on
shipboard, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he ought to get after them to-day.
So much hurry and scurry on the last
day that he might miss some of the contributions."</p>

<p>A little later consternation was thrown into the
"contributors" to the Widows and Orphans
Fund. A very businesslike young steward armed
with a list, began his collections. Two or three
of the collegians paid up without protest for they
supposed such collections were the regular thing,
but when the collector reached McGregor, who
was still holding the fort with Marjorie in the
shade of one of the lifeboats, he met a refusal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Twenty-five dollars for the Widows and Orphans
Fund! I never heard of it before!" protested
the "contributor."</p>

<p>"There must be a mistake, sir," said the steward,
"you must have forgotten, your name is one
of those on the subscription paper in the companionway
bulletin board."</p>

<p>"My name on the paper? Quit your kidding."</p>

<p>"O, but it is, sir. I made a careful copy myself,
sir, of all the names, and I'm sure I'm right."</p>

<p>"Then I must have done it in my sleep," exclaimed
the puzzled McGregor. "Where is the
bulletin board?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you, sir," and the steward led the
way to the saloon deck. Shortly they stood before
the board in question. There were a number
of notices on the board, but the steward
pointed out the one in question. "There it is,
sir, and there's your name," triumphantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We, the Undersigned, subscribe to the Widows
and Orphans Fund the amount set after
each of our names:"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McGregor's jaw dropped as he read the notice.
Then in amazement his eye traveled down the
long list of signatures till it fell on his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is sure enough my signature and no forgery.
But when in the name of Mike did I do
it?" He gazed in helpless wonder at Marjorie
who had accompanied him to the companionway.</p>

<p>"Seems to me I've seen that list before," said
Miss Hasbrouck. "It looks like one that was
attached to a letter I received to-day."</p>

<p>McGregor stepped up to the board, scrutinized
the subscription paper closely, then took out the
thumb tacks which secured it to the board itself.
"Look," he said, displaying the back of the paper.
"The Codfish has put one over on us. This list
has been very neatly pasted onto the bottom of the
Widows and Orphans Fund subscription paper,
and as both were written on ship's paper the deception
was a clever one."</p>

<p>"O, my, the wretch!" said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"The young runt," quoth McGregor in high
dudgeon, "wait till I get at him!"</p>

<p>But he did not get at the Codfish just then for
that individual kept himself out of sight until the
next morning. The story went the rounds of the
ship as might naturally be expected, and not a
few of the team members, seeing that the Codfish
had made a neat shift of the joke onto their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
own heads, paid up their alleged subscriptions so
that the Fund was a gainer in the end.</p>

<p>Sad to relate, however, the standing of the
Codfish with the Hasbrouck family was gone,
never to return. His best efforts next morning
failed to draw even a look of recognition from
Marjorie's bright eyes as she passed and repassed
him during the deck promenade, tripping along
gaily between two members of the team. Once
he thought he caught the expression as she
passed: "That horrid boy." From Mrs. Hasbrouck
he could only draw a frigid nod.</p>

<p>"And that's all the thanks I get for boosting
the old fund," said the Codfish to himself.
"Well, never mind, women are fickle. I'll have
no more of them in my whole life," and he went
his way whistling a merry tune.</p>

<p>That afternoon as the ship was passing up
Southampton Water the Codfish found Frank
leaning on the rail watching the beautiful and
ever-shifting panorama opening before him.</p>

<p>"Say, Frank, I guess I'll not go on to Paris."</p>

<p>"Changed your mind?" There was a hint of
laughter in Frank's voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I ought to stick around for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
practice and the games, don't you? Doesn't
seem quite right to desert now."</p>

<p>"Good boy," said Frank. "I think you'll find
England more congenial than Paris. It wouldn't
be right to leave us anyway."</p>

<p>"That's what I think, too. I'll stick with the
bunch."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII. <span class="subtit">THE CODFISH LOSES HIMSELF.</span></h2>

<p>The team with all its paraphernalia went
through to London that night, and the next morning
took train for Brighton about fifty miles
south on the English Channel, where all were
quartered at the Grand Hotel on the Esplanade
facing the channel. Training quarters were
established on the grounds of the Brighton Athletic
Club which had been generously offered to
the visitors by the Board of Governors.</p>

<p>It was an eager lot of athletes that tumbled
out of the tally-ho at the Club that morning, for
the trainers insisted that the practice should begin
at once, and the men themselves, cooped up as
they had been for a week, were no less anxious to
get to work than the trainers were to have them.</p>

<p>Several scores of people, attracted to Brighton
by the news that the Yale and Harvard teams
would train there for the week previous to the
match with Oxford and Cambridge, were in attendance
when the Americans got into action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
"A likely looking lot," was the English comment.</p>

<p>After a light work-out, Armstrong and McGregor
were called to the jumping pit.</p>

<p>"Try a few," said Trainer Black, "but make it
easy and be careful you don't twist your ankles.
We're badly enough off as it is."</p>

<p>After measuring out the runway and taking
half a dozen practice runs, McGregor made a
leap of something over 21 feet on his first try.
Frank followed, but did not show anything impressive.
Again he tried, but whether from the
enforced idleness on the steamer or from physical
condition, again fell far short of the jump he expected
to make.</p>

<p>"You're not getting any lift at all," said Black,
coming up at that moment. "Shoot high in the
air when you strike that take-off."</p>

<p>Frank attempted to follow instructions, but his
legs felt heavy and dead. He knew very well
without information from the trainer that he
failed to get his height. The more he jumped,
the worse he got, but persisted until Trainer
Black said: "That's enough, now. Jog around
the track a couple of times and go in. You are
off to-day but I guess it will be all right to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>But the next day, while there was a little improvement
in his distance, Frank was far behind
his American performances. McGregor jumped
consistently at 22 feet and a half. The strange
ground did not seem to bother him in any way,
while with Frank either the straight runway, the
different conditions of air or the week of partial
idleness on shipboard had played havoc with his
skill. Naturally, he began to worry, and this
had its effect in keeping him back.</p>

<p>On the third day on English soil the whole
team was taken up to London to the Queen's Club
grounds so that the athletes might have an opportunity
to try out the track. It proved to be a
faster and better track than the one they were
working on at Brighton and everyone was well
pleased with the result of the day's work. Frank
had improved a little on his jumps, but was still
inches behind his Harvard mate. Several times
he had succeeded in getting a good spring, but
failed to hold the distance. It did not make him
feel any happier to note that the English writers,
after watching the performances of the two
American jumpers, had counted them out of the
contest entirely.</p>

<p>"Vare," wrote one sporting critic, "will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
no trouble in winning the broad jump for the
American representatives are not in his class. It
is unfortunate that their best jumper was unable
to come across the water because of an accident
in practice a few days before the Americans were
to sail. But even with Hotchkiss, the injured
Yale man, at his best he could not expect to
measure up to the great Oxford jumper who has
been doing 23 feet and over, consistently in practice,
and has never yet been extended to his full
limit to win in any event he has entered. With
the broad jump a foregone conclusion for the Oxford-Cambridge
team, the chances seem to favor
the English athletes to carry off the meet."</p>

<p>Frank laid down the paper. "So, they've written
us off, have they? Perhaps we may fool them
yet," and he ground his teeth together, resolving
that if he were beaten out it would not be because
he did not try. But the next day's practice
on the Brighton track yielded no better
results. As he was walking slowly down the runway
with feelings of disgust at his poor showing,
he was accosted by a tall stranger whom he had
seen talking with the captain a few minutes before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mind if I give you a word of advice?"
said the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. If you can show me how to
get out about a foot further, I'll be the happiest
jumper in the United Kingdom."</p>

<p>The stranger smiled. "You are too anxious
about this jumping business," he said, "and
you're working too hard at it. You have plenty
of speed and a good spring, but you don't get
high enough at the take-off. Supposing we try
a little experiment."</p>

<p>"I'll try anything," said Frank, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I used to jump a little myself," said the
stranger, "and my trouble at first was very like
what yours is now. I couldn't get up. So I tried
an experiment which I'm going to try on you
now." Stepping to the side of the track he picked
up a high hurdle and placed it about four feet behind
the jumping-block, in the pit itself. "Now,"
he continued, "I want you to clear the top of that
hurdle by six inches or more. At your highest
point of flight bring your shoulders and arms well
forward, so you will hold all your distance when
you strike. Try it."</p>

<p>Frank went back the full length of the runway,
started at an easy lope and gathering full speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
fifty feet from the end of his run struck the
block squarely, and sprang high into the air. He
had the feeling that it was a good jump but was
not prepared for what the measuring tape showed&mdash;22
feet, 8 inches.</p>

<p>"That's better," said the tall stranger. "But
I want you to go even higher than that. Clear
the hurdle by a foot or more if you can. Get
your greatest speed right at the take-off and
<em>think</em> high as well as go high."</p>

<p>Again Frank rushed down the runway and
leaped with all his power, clearing the hurdle by
a foot or more. By this time half a dozen of
the members of the team were gathered by the
jumping pit. Recognizing a good jump, one of
them seized the tape and measured:</p>

<p>"Twenty-three feet, one-half inch," he sang
out. "Well, maybe we have a chance for that
jump yet. Good boy, Armstrong."</p>

<p>Twice more the stranger sent Frank down the
runway and each time the jumper rose to expectations.
On the last jump the tape showed 23
feet, 1&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>"Now, we'll take the hurdle away, but you
must <em>think</em> it is there," continued the coach.
"Have it in your mind as you come up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
block that you are going away above the imaginary
mark. Jumping is a matter of brains as
much as of legs. Try it without the hurdle."</p>

<p>This time Frank almost equaled his former
jump, and as the figures were announced, his
teammates crowded around him, congratulating
him.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff, Armstrong," said Trainer
Black. "You may throw a scare into these Englishmen
if you keep up that gait."</p>

<p>"Who is that man coaching me?" inquired
Frank, a little later.</p>

<p>"That, didn't you know? That's Princewell,
an intercollegiate champion of ours a few years
back, one of the best in the business in his day."</p>

<p>"He certainly knew what was the matter with
me," said Frank, almost beside himself with happiness.
"I'd give a leg to beat Vare."</p>

<p>"I don't expect that," said Black, "because
Vare is a great jumper, one of the best in Great
Britain. If you give him a good run for his
money you will have done something we will all
be proud of. We can win without the broad
jump if our calculations are right."</p>

<p>But alas for Frank's high hopes, the next day
saw him below 23 feet again, and work as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
might, he fell back steadily. Without the impetus
given by Princewell, who had gone to
London, he could not get within six inches
of his best marks of the day before. Black finally
ordered him to the clubhouse. "I don't want you
to put on jumping shoes again before Saturday."
Saturday was the day of the games.</p>

<p>"But I need the practice," Frank remonstrated,
"I'm just getting the knack."</p>

<p>"Forget it," said the trainer, "and do as I tell
you. I'll take the risk. You mustn't jump again
before you go into your event. And I'd advise
you to keep off your feet as much as you can.
Rest, rest, man. That's the best thing you can
do just now."</p>

<p>Frank turned away heartbroken. "If I could
only keep at it, I'd get the trick back. I had it
yesterday and I've lost it to-day."</p>

<p>"Keep off my feet," grumbled Frank that night
to Gleason. "Rest and keep off my feet. I wonder
if he intends to have me keep my bed."</p>

<p>"O, you're too nervous, that's all. A little
country air would be good for you. Say, by
Jove, I've got an idea, rest, recreation, off your
feet, on the job and all that."</p>

<p>"Open up, my son."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's this. Let's hire a motor and see some of
this blooming country. I don't suppose they
object to your exercising your eyes."</p>

<p>"I'm with you if the captain hasn't any objection.
We've been sticking pretty closely around
here."</p>

<p>"It's a monumental idea and worthy of a great
brain like mine."</p>

<p>The captain had no objection and was indeed
glad of it since he felt it would take Frank's
attention from the coming games.</p>

<p>"And how about the motor? I'm not a bloated
bondholder like you, but I'll go my halves."</p>

<p>"Oh, run away. I've been aching to find an
excuse to spend some money round here. I know
where I can get a little pippin of a machine for
ten shillings the hour. Ten shillings are $2.50
our money and cheap when it includes a dinky
little chauffeur with a uniform. Watch me produce!"
And away the Codfish dashed down the
street. In twenty minutes he was back with a
snappy little, high-powered runabout painted a
flaming red color. "Couldn't get a blue one," he
apologized.</p>

<p>Frank hopped in alongside the driver, and the
Codfish perched behind in the rumble seat. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
two hours Frank forgot entirely about the Yale-Harvard-Oxford-Cambridge
track meet, and his
part in it. And those who have traveled in the
beautiful lanes and highways of Sussex will understand
his absorption. Again in the cool of
the afternoon Gleason appeared for another "personally
conducted" tour, this time to the west
of Brighton, along the shore road. Eye-tired
from watching the moving panorama of country
and town, Frank Armstrong slept, free from the
regular nightmare of broad-jumping competition
in which he never could quite reach his best.</p>

<p>The great day of the contest came around at
last and found the American athletes pitched to
a high degree of excitement. A final trial of
the Queen's Club track had given some very satisfactory
performances, which more than hinted
at an American victory. Burrows, the Harvard
sprinter, had run the hundred in nine and four-fifths
seconds, and seemed sure of not only this
event but of the two hundred and twenty as well.
With these two secure, the American athletes had
a clear lead in the race for victory.</p>

<p>"This is the great day, boys," announced
Trainer Black at the breakfast table. "Train
leaves for London at 10:30. Games at two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
o'clock. Put all the stuff you need in your suit
cases. They will go up on the train with us."</p>

<p>"Do we lunch in London?" asked someone.</p>

<p>"No, we have a bite on the train which gets
to London at a little before twelve. It's a half-hour's
ride in taxis from the station to the
Queen's Club grounds. We won't get there
much before half past twelve or a quarter to
one. That'll give us plenty of time to dress and
be ready for the Johnny Bulls by two o'clock."</p>

<p>Frank finished his packing quickly, sent his
suit case down to the hotel lobby, and began to
fidget around. "I'm as nervous as a cat," he said
to himself. "If they had only let me keep on
working I'd have been a lot better off, but this
waiting, waiting bothers me to death."</p>

<p>"Oh, there, you little jumping jack," came the
hail from the street, "come and take a ride, guaranteed
last appearance before breaking the
world's record."</p>

<p>"Can't," said Frank. "Train leaves in less
than two hours. Have you packed up?"</p>

<p>"Packed up, no. The valet will do that. Who
wants to pack suit cases a morning like this?
Come on, you short-skate, come on and forget
Queen's Club."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go you for an hour," said Frank, "but
that's the limit. I don't want to take any chances
with a busted tire five miles from nowhere."</p>

<p>"This machine is guaranteed bust-proof. You
can trust the old reliable. It is even fool-proof."</p>

<p>"I'd need that assurance with you around."</p>

<p>"And you're coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but only for an hour."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'll have you back, hope to die
if I don't."</p>

<p>Away shot the little runabout on the Eastbourne
road. As before, the chauffeur acted as
guide and pointed out various objects of interest
as they spun along the smooth road. "Just down
there to the east about twenty miles the way
we're heading is Hastings."</p>

<p>"That's where William the Conqueror had his
little scrap one day some moons ago, isn't it?"
inquired the Codfish.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he fought a bit of a fight there, and
just over to the left there is the Duke of Buccleuch's
estate. And down there in the field
where you see that house in the trees I was born
meself, sir."</p>

<p>"Good for you," said the Codfish, "fine place
to be born, nice open spaces; a very good piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of judgment. And the old folks still live down
on the old New Hampshire farm?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they are living there now. I say,
would you mind stopping at the door, sir? My
mother's been ailing, and I'd like to see her a
minute."</p>

<p>"Dutiful and kind-hearted son, we'll be happy
to stop for you. Better still, you give me the
steering wheel and we'll drive on for a mile or two
and pick you up on the way back."</p>

<p>"Can you drive?" asked the chauffeur dubiously.</p>

<p>"Can I drive? Can a duck float? I've driven
a six-sixty Pierce Arrow through the White
Mountains, but you wouldn't know what that
means. Let's see," said the irrepressible Codfish,
as he slipped into the driver's seat just vacated by
the chauffeur and worked the shift lever as he
spoke: "First speed inside ahead, second speed
outside ahead, high, outside back. Reverse, inside
back. I've got you, Steve. We'll be back
here in fifteen minutes. Please be waiting at the
church for we haven't too many spare minutes
this morning."</p>

<p>"Be careful, sir," called the chauffeur, "it's a
heavy penalty driving without a license."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Same thing in our country, but we're hard to
catch," the Codfish shouted back over his
shoulder as, with motor speeding up, he dropped
into high gear and fled up the road like a red
shadow.</p>

<p>"This is what we should have done long before
this," quoth Gleason, "a chauffeur is a clog on
conversation."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's handy to have along under certain
conditions."</p>

<p>The boys drove along in silence for five minutes,
when Frank, with his mind on train time,
said: "Better turn now, old man. We've been
out nearly thirty minutes, and thirty more makes
an hour, my time limit."</p>

<p>"You're great on mathematics. Let's go up
this road through the village there to our right
and out back on the main road, pick up the gent
who went to visit the old folks, and then I'll drop
you in dear old Brighton in some few minutes.
But first let us explore a little."</p>

<p>"I'd rather we explored some other time,"
Frank remonstrated.</p>

<p>But the Codfish was willful. He found a road
leading to the left, circled the village and came
back again to a highway. "Now, let's see, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
did we leave that chap?" he mused. "Right along
here some place by the willows, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Driving slowly, the boys scanned the roadside
for their chauffeur, but no sight of him could they
discover. "Well, it certainly was here somewhere,
and if he hasn't the gumption to come
back as per agreement, he can stay behind, eh,
what?"</p>

<p>"Gleason, this doesn't look like the road we
came on," said Frank, in alarm.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good road, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But no road is good unless it leads to Brighton.
Remember your promise. That train leaves
at ten-thirty and it is five minutes of ten now.
And, moreover, we're lost."</p>

<p>"Lost, your eye! How can we be lost when I'm
at the helm?" But, nevertheless, the puzzled look
on the Codfish's face continued to grow deeper as
the minutes passed away and nothing was seen
of the chauffeur. "I say," he called to a passing
farmer, "can you tell me if this is the road to
Brighton?"</p>

<p>"Naw. Second turn to the right and then keep
straight ahead."</p>

<p>"How far from here?"</p>

<p>"'Bout five mile."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"The country is saved. Now see the dust fly.
Twenty minutes to do five miles. Oh, it's a cinch.
That chauffeur can walk home. I'll settle."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the Codfish drew up at
the outskirts of a small village. "Is this the way
to Brighton?" he inquired of a passer-by.</p>

<p>"This <em>is</em> Breyting," with an accent on the "is."</p>

<p>"What?" almost yelled the driver of the red
car.</p>

<p>"This <em>is</em> Breyting, I tell you."</p>

<p>"How do you spell it?"</p>

<p>"B-r-e-y-t-i-n-g, Breyting."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, we want B-r-i-g-h-t-o-n, Brighton,
down by the sea, where all the piers and pebbles
are."</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you say so at first? Take the
road to the left down about half a mile. It'll
bring you down to the far end of the street that
runs along the water."</p>

<p>"How far is it?" asked Frank in a despairing
voice.</p>

<p>"'Bout twelve or thirteen miles."</p>

<p>"And fifteen minutes to do it in. This is awful!"</p>

<p>"Cheer up, cheer up," said the driver, making a
great show of confidence which he didn't in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
least feel. "We may do it yet." Opening the
throttle the car fairly leaped along the road.
"It's exceeding the speed limit, but in a good
cause," said the Codfish. "Lord, I hope the tires
stand up."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken the word when the right
front shoe gave way with a loud bang. The car
careened to the right sharply, crossed the shallow
ditch with a lurch that nearly threw the boys
out of their seats, and, finally, under control
again, was steered back on to the road to fetch
up with a violent jerk when the emergency brake
was driven down hard.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII. <span class="subtit">THE FLYING MACHINE TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>

<p>"Well, I'm glad that's over," said the luckless
Codfish, as he slipped from behind the steering
wheel and hurried out in front to see what damage
had been done. "Phew! we're lucky," he
continued, "to be alive. If that shoe had gone
and busted itself on the bridge half a mile back
we would probably have been two bright little
angels by now; gone and done for."</p>

<p>"By the looks of things, I'm done for anyway,"
said Frank. "We are lost some miles from
Brighton and," looking at his watch, "the train
starts in just seven minutes."</p>

<p>"Maybe they'll wait for you."</p>

<p>"Royal mail trains never wait, and that carries
the mail. It's twenty minutes' work to put
that shoe on."</p>

<p>"Shoe, nothing. I put no shoe on. We'll pick
up some wayside garage and till that happens
I'll drive on the rim. No damage is done on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
flight up the bank. Here we go, halting but
steady."</p>

<p>Frank was silent. He was thinking of the
effect his absence would have on his teammates.
It hurt him to think that his captain would set
his nonappearance down to carelessness, and
so it had been in a way. He should not have
gone so far. He should have insisted that Gleason
keep away from the steering wheel. Perhaps
the need for his presence would be desperate.
His absence might mean, in some unaccountable
way, the loss of the meet. These thoughts and
many others pounded through his brain as the
car limped along the road, but they all had the
same refrain: "You've been a failure, you've
been a failure."</p>

<p>Rounding a turn in the road, Gleason caught
sight of a garage sign, and in a minute drew up
at the door. "Ten shillings to put that tire on
and put it on quickly," said he. Two workmen
from the garage sprang at the wheel, but they had
scarcely begun work when a clock in a neighboring
church tower boomed the half-hour. The
boys looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I know how you feel, Frank," said Gleason.
"I was a double-barreled jackass to take you off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
this morning, and seventeen times a fool for getting
lost."</p>

<p>"I'm in very badly with everyone," said Frank,
"but growling will not help matters. Maybe
there'll be a later train which will get me there in
time."</p>

<p>"I've got you into this, Frank, and I'll get you
out of it somehow, don't worry. There must be
another train."</p>

<p>With the new shoe on the front wheel and the
garage men the richer by several shillings more
than the Codfish promised, the red runabout was
again headed for Brighton, this time at a more
moderate pace. It was just eleven o'clock when
the car drew up at the railroad station. Frank
almost expected to see some of his teammates,
but the platform and waiting-rooms were deserted.
Inquiries at the ticket office brought the
information that the next London train was at
twelve-fifteen and did not reach London till one-fifty.</p>

<p>"One-fifty," groaned Frank. "I might as well
take the next ship back to America. I've lost
out. I'm disgraced." Both boys were the picture
of gloom.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gleason's face lit with high resolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
"Look here, Armstrong, I'll take you to London
in this machine."</p>

<p>"But it isn't ours, and you have no license to
drive."</p>

<p>"It's ours as long as we pay ten shillings an
hour for it, license or no license."</p>

<p>"You'd get lost again."</p>

<p>"No, no, it's a straight road. I looked it up
once. You follow the railroad. Look here," he
added in great excitement, "the thing can be
done without a grain of doubt. Here it is a little
past eleven. We can certainly average twenty-five
miles an hour. That means that we can be
there a little after one. Fortunately, the Club
is but a little ways out of our course, over in
West Kensington."</p>

<p>"I'm game for it," said Frank, "but just the
same, I don't like the idea of your going off
with a machine and no license. You'll get jugged
for sure if anything goes wrong."</p>

<p>"Nothing's going wrong. I got you into this
trouble and I'm going to get you out somehow.
Climb in and hold onto your headgear, we are
only going to hit the high places." He shot away
from the station and swung into the great north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
road, sign-marked "London," with the motor
humming to the quickened pace.</p>

<p>"Nothing to it, Frank," boasted the confident
chauffeur. "This is the way they all should have
come up, plenty of ozone and action, no stuffy
cars. We may even beat them to the club if we
have luck," and he pushed the gas lever a few
notches higher, and neatly dodged a dog curled
up in the sand of the road.</p>

<p>Now that he was headed for London, even
Frank's spirits rose. What seemed no chance
half an hour ago had been transformed into a
possibility. Well he knew that Gleason was exceeding
the speed limit, but the time was so
short a chance had to be taken with tires, road,
police and everything else. The stake was worth
it.</p>

<p>One cannot race along the roads of south-east
England and race very far. So the inevitable
happened. Ten miles outside of Brighton, when
Gleason was doing something better than forty
miles an hour, he pretended not to hear a hail
from the side of the road, and kept straight on,
but he could not help hearing the sharp spatter
of a motorcycle behind him a minute later, and
instinctively knew it was the police. He slowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
down till he was running at about fifteen miles
an hour. The officer came alongside. He was
plainly angry. "Why didn't you stop when I
called to you?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you call?" asked the Codfish innocently.</p>

<p>"We are in a great hurry," explained Frank.
"We have to be there by one o'clock or one-thirty
at the latest."</p>

<p>"Now maybe you will and maybe you won't.
Turn that car around and come along with me."</p>

<p>"Look here, this chap here," indicating Frank,
"is in that track meet up at Queen's Club at two
o'clock this afternoon. He lost his train by accident
and I promised to get him there. Now, let
us go through."</p>

<p>"Can't be done. You Americans all try to
tear through the country at break-neck speed.
You can't do it here, I tell you. Let's see your
license."</p>

<p>The Codfish began fumbling in his pockets.
"Great Scott! I haven't got the thing anywhere
about my jeans, the chauffeur must have it, bad
luck to him."</p>

<p>"Another thing to explain to the magistrate.
Come along now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The Codfish reluctantly tacked the car around
and followed his guide to the little hamlet where
the officer first hailed him from the roadside.</p>

<p>To the disgust of the two American youths
the magistrate could not be found, a piece of
news imparted to them by the officer after a
ten minutes' search around the little court building
off the main street.</p>

<p>"Well, now, let us go along," insisted the Codfish.
"We've made our call, the magistrate isn't
in. We've done our duty, now let's call it off.
When you come to America I'll get you a job
on the police force of Syracuse. Come on, be a
good scout and let's be hitting the gravel. This
fellow here with me has to jump in the
track games at Queen's Club grounds, and
it will be a great disappointment to his
friends if he can't be there, to say nothing
about his own feelings. Think how
it would be if he were your own offspring
and was jumping for the English to help lick the
Yankees." His cross-fire on the officer might
possibly have had some effect if affairs had not
taken a new and sudden turn for the worse. As
the Codfish was making his arguments, a messenger
came up and handed the officer a note. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
read it, looked over our friends who were still
seated in the car and ran his eye over the car.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty slick young fellow," he said,
"but both of you will stay with us for a while.
You are in pretty deep."</p>

<p>"How so?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"As if you didn't know! Perhaps you never
heard of this," and he read the message he had
just received: "Stop and hold two young men
in red runabout Number 1664B. Stolen from
chauffeur near Brighton, known to have started
for London shortly after eleven o'clock." The
message was signed by the Chief of Police of
Brighton.</p>

<p>"A lovely kettle of fish," commented Gleason.
"Do you remember once of telling me that I
could get into trouble in a desert island?"</p>

<p>"I do and it's true."</p>

<p>"It would be still true if I were alone in the
middle of the Pacific. But there's one thing about
this business which cheers me: you are now a
member of the Criminal Club at Yale in good
standing."</p>

<p>"I'd rather be in good standing up at Queen's
Club. Do you realize that the team is at London
now and we are in the lock-up?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>For the greater part of an hour Frank and
Gleason were held in durance vile as automobile
thieves, and as a secondary count, breaking the
speed limit. But all things finally come to an
end. The magistrate was found, and sat with
great dignity on the case. One of his first acts
was to fine Gleason the sum of five pounds for
excessive speed and then to declare him still
liable to the charge of theft. Fortunately for
the Codfish and Frank, who momentarily expected
to be thrown into the village jail, the
chauffeur, who had been overcome with the desire
to see his parents that morning and who
had been the innocent cause of most of the trouble,
appeared with the proprietor of the garage
where the little red runabout had been obtained.</p>

<p>Explanations soon followed. The garage proprietor
verified all that the boys said about their
being a part of the American team and followers,
and his hand being properly greased with
American dollars from the plethoric purse of
Gleason, was perfectly willing that the car should
go on to London, driven by his own chauffeur.</p>

<p>"But remember," said the magistrate, "not over
twenty miles an hour or you'll be brought in before
you get to your journey's end."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"At twenty miles an hour," said Frank, "it is
no more good to us than an ox-cart. It is nearly
one o'clock now and two hours on the road would
bring us there too late. I guess it's too late all
right," and he turned away, deeply moved by the
thought that his hard work, the three thousand-mile
trip across the water, the ambitions of himself
and of his friends, all went for naught.
Tears of chagrin came to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing on earth can save us now," acquiesced
the Codfish. "O Lord, if I only had
an aeroplane with about a hundred horse-power
motor in it," he wailed.</p>

<p>"Guess they could accommodate you down at
Burtside," said the officer who, now the incident
was closed, showed a friendly interest in the two
young men.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Frank burst out.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a flyin' school down at Burtside,
'bout half a mile from here. Perhaps they'd rent
one to you young chaps for the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Great Peter!" cried the Codfish, "let's try.
Here's a chance. Here," to the returned chauffeur,
"drive us down to that aeroplane place if
you know where it is. I'm going to buy one."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the chauffeur, thinking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the young Americans had better be favored for
they were very likely mad as March hares. How
could they be otherwise, having first run away
with his machine and then, being deprived of
that, willing to buy an air craft to continue the
journey. But he piloted the boys to Burtside
which proved to be a flying school of some importance
with biplanes and monoplanes in the
hangars, and two or three beginners at the flying
game, receiving instruction. The boys quickly
explained their errand. They wanted to get to
London in desperate haste, trains couldn't accomplish
it, automobiles at the rate they let them run
over English roads couldn't and there was no
other way but the air. The director of the school
was not sure whether it could be done or not.
Money, Gleason told him, was no object, which
played its part in the decision. By good fortune
one of the aviators in the school was a young
American who had been flying with great success
in England for a year. He heard of the
plight of his compatriots, and readily agreed to
take Frank up. He would take one or the other,
but not both.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to pay $200 if you will take Frank
Armstrong to the Queen's Club, or as near to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
point as you can get, and I'll give you an equal
amount not to take me."</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid," said Butler, "I have
no machine that will carry more than one passenger.
It will have to be only one of you."</p>

<p>"That suits us both. Armstrong, here, wants
to go and I don't, so we're all satisfied."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been up?" inquired Butler of
Frank.</p>

<p>"Never, but I'm determined to get to London
if I can, and I don't care how it is."</p>

<p>"All right," said Butler. "We have no time to
lose. I'll get out the big biplane." The plane
was run out of the hangar, examined closely by
the attendants, looked over in a cursory manner
by the aviator himself. "Now," he said to Frank,
"hop up here alongside of me, to the right. Take
hold of that wooden support and put your feet
on this wire. Don't look down or you may get
dizzy. I'm going about five hundred feet high.
Keep your eyes straight ahead and forget you're
flying."</p>

<p>"Good-by, old fellow," said the Codfish, half
in fun and half in earnest, as Frank climbed to
his precarious place alongside the aviator, and
then to Butler, "Where do you come down?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"One can never tell in this business, but I will
try to land in Hendon, which is only about three
miles from the Club."</p>

<p>"And how long will it take?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere about thirty minutes if the wind
aloft is as steady and strong as it seems to be
down here."</p>

<p>"Frank, that will get you to Hendon at one-forty-five,
and a taxi will do the rest. I'll come
as fast as I can in the motor, and if we don't
get pinched again I may get to dear old London
in time to see the finish."</p>

<p>"All ready," sang out Butler. A half dozen
attendants clung fast to the trail of the big biplane
while another spun the propeller. The engine
immediately sprang into noisy life, the roar
of the exhaust drowning out all human speech in
the neighborhood. Gleason saw the hands of the
aviator drop off the steering-wheel in a downward
sweeping signal which meant "let go," a signal
instantly obeyed by the attendants, who dropped
flat on the ground while the great tail of the
birdlike monster swept over their heads with an
ever increasing rush. For fifty or sixty feet the
running gear of the machine kept on the ground,
but, as the velocity increased and Butler elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
his plane, the machine gradually cleared the earth
and soared aloft. The Codfish watched it as it
rose and followed it in the vastness of the sky
vault until there was but a mere dot against the
fluffy clouds in the northern sky.</p>

<p>We will leave Frank Armstrong shooting Londonward
in the largest passenger-carrying biplane
in the Burtside School for Aviators, seated
on a mere chip of a seat, holding on with a death
grip to the slender upright of seasoned spruce,
and turn our attention back to the morning at
Brighton.</p>

<p>Contrary to what Gleason and Frank imagined
as they sat in their disabled motor on the highway
some miles outside of Brighton at the hour
their train was scheduled to leave, they were not
missed at first. In the hurry of leaving their temporary
training quarters, the team managers and
assistants had so much to do that they left the
business of getting from the hotel to the station,
a matter of only a few hundred yards, to the
individuals themselves. No one happened to
notice, as they left the hotel in straggling groups
of three and four, that Armstrong was not with
them. At the station half a dozen compartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
on the London train having been reserved in advance,
the athletes tumbled aboard without even
a thought of luggage, taking it for granted, with
the usual cheerful carelessness of traveling athletes,
that everything would be all right. Each
was concerned only for himself. It was not to
be thought of for a moment that any member of
either team would be so foolish as to get himself
left behind.</p>

<p>The ten-thirty on the London and Brighton
was the vestibule and corridor type of train, not
like the ordinary single compartment coach in
common use on English and Continental railroads.
It was therefore possible to pass from
car to car and from compartment to compartment
on this train much the same as on an American
Pullman train, and visiting between team
members shortly began. Trainer Black, going
the rounds, discovered that Armstrong was missing.</p>

<p>At first it was thought that he, with his companion
Gleason, had accidentally gotten into a
wrong compartment, but a hasty search from end
to end of the train disclosed the fact that he was
not aboard at all.</p>

<p>"I don't remember having seen him after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
breakfast," said the Yale captain. "Could he
have gone up to London on the train ahead of us
by any chance?"</p>

<p>"No," returned McGregor, "Armstrong is very
conscientious and would not disobey orders which
were explicit enough about this train."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a hat," said Halloby, "that his rattle-headed
friend, Codfish Gleason, took him out for
a ride this morning, and that something went
wrong with the power-plant, and they are sitting
on the road somewhere waiting for someone to
tow them home."</p>

<p>And, as it proved, Hurdler Halloby wasn't so
far out of the way, excepting that, instead of sitting
on the road, they were at that moment falling
with a loud report into the hands of the
law. So, perhaps, it was well that no one on
the American team knew their exact location.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it," said another, "I saw the
chap they call Codfish swing around to the hotel
this morning in a red runabout and a little later
saw the runabout going off up the street, but
didn't notice who was in it. But I do know that
all three seats were full."</p>

<p>"That's enough," said Black. "Gleason thinks
he is the sole and special guard of Armstrong's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
health and happiness, and hired that automobile
for the purpose of keeping the jumper's mind occupied
with something besides jumping. I agreed
to it myself. Now we lose a man on account of
it."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness," broke in the captain, "we
didn't have to depend on him for an event or
we'd have been in a bad way. If he should get
to the grounds in time after all, I'd feel like punishing
him by not allowing him to jump," snapped
the captain.</p>

<p>"He's punished already," said Black. "Probably
eating his heart out somewhere. He's the
most conscientious fellow I ever saw. It's his
fool friend, the Codfish, who got him into any
trouble that he's in."</p>

<p>"I'll telegraph him to come on the next train,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"Will not do much good, I guess, the next train
wouldn't get him there in time. But don't worry,
he'll be there at those games if he hasn't met with
a serious accident, or I miss my guess badly, but
as for his doing any good, it's another matter."</p>

<p>"It's too bad," growled Captain Harrington.
"The papers will throw the hot shot into us for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
being careless. It makes us all look like dummies,
confound the luck!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, Captain. You have
enough on your hands, and Vare is a certain winner
anyway in Armstrong's event. You have
your own troubles this afternoon in the quarter.
So take it easy, and quit worrying about something
that really doesn't matter a great deal as far
as actual results go."</p>

<p>"I'm going to telegraph, just the same," returned
the captain, "to the Grand. They would
probably go there when they found we had gone,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, it will do no harm," admitted Black.</p>

<p>So Harrington sent off a telegram from a station
fifteen miles or so from London. A bit
peremptory the telegram was, but it relieved the
captain's feelings. This was the telegram:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Frank Armstrong, The Grand, Brighton.
Come to London on next train, take taxi to
Queen's Club immediately afterwards. Absolutely
no excuse for missing team train."</p></blockquote>

<p>But this telegram, as we have seen, never
reached the man for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>At one o'clock taxicabs dropped the Yale-Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
athletes, attendants, and trainers at the
south gate of Queen's Club. Already several
thousand people had gathered in the stands, and
a steady stream was pouring in the gates, not
with the impetuosity that distinguishes an American
crowd, but interested withal in the games
they were shortly to see. The majority of the
crowd was, of course, English, but the Americans
made a brave showing. They gathered together,
apparently for mutual support, halfway down
the track stretch and at once selected a cheer
leader who was now working up enthusiasm by
an occasional yell, simply to let the enemy know
that young America would be heard from in
more ways than one. A surprising number of
Americans had come together for the event. Not
all were Harvard and Yale men, although members
of these two institutions predominated. Students
and graduates from universities all over
the United States might have been seen in the
crowd. It was not a Harvard-Yale affair to
them, it was America against England, and
everyone from the far side of the Atlantic was
there to lend a shout for his countrymen. College
lines were forgotten.</p>

<p>Along the track-side and in the grand stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
speculation was rife as to the outcome of the
games. Experts had figured out just how the
various men were to finish, and the figures had
been printed in the morning papers and in the
noon editions. All admitted, however, that the
match would be an extremely close one with the
chances slightly in favor of the visitors.</p>

<p>"Well," said one confident young man in the
group of Americans, "we'll take the hundred,
two-twenty and both the hurdles. I'd bet my
last dollar on that. These Englishmen can't get
their legs moving in a short distance."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, but then when it comes to the longer
distance we can't keep our wind going. That's
where they have us."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, there's Harrington, the
Yale captain, who can certainly get away with
the quarter. He's been doing under fifty seconds
right along. He will give us the fifth event,
and all we need to tie is one more, and to win,
two more. Why, Dick, old fel, it's a cinch."</p>

<p>"And what are the other two events, please,
Sir Prophet?"</p>

<p>"Shot for one, they can't beat old red-top McGinnis.
These English chaps never learned how
to put a shot anyway, and there's the high jump,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
certainly ours; it's like taking money from a
baby."</p>

<p>"Sounds like seven wins, the way you have it
figured out."</p>

<p>"It is seven places or my training as to what
five and two make is all to the bad. I tell you
it's a cinch. I'd put up all my spare cash on it,
and walk home cheerfully if I lost out. But,
pshaw! we can't lose!"</p>

<p>Conversation was checked by the appearance
of several athletes who had emerged from the
Club locker-room doorway, and who were walking
across the turfed stretch to the track. They
were seen to be Americans, and a ringing shout
went up from their supporters which brought
smiles to the faces of the young athletes. The
English spectators applauded the Americans with
hand-clapping. By twos and threes the athletes
made their appearance on the track before the
hour set for the beginning of the games, for the
day was bright and warm and the sun of more
advantage to them than the shade and cool of
the training quarters.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to narrate in detail the
doings of the half hundred athletes who struggled
for the honor of their colleges and country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
that afternoon nor how records fell and predictions
of experts were set at naught, how the
balance swung this way and that, how the mercurial
American cheer-leader ruined the throats
of his countrymen for the encouragement of the
team striving desperately on field and track. We
are more intimately concerned with Frank Armstrong
whom we left a thousand feet more or
less in the air, taking a last desperate chance to
be in at the finish on the Queen's Club track.</p>

<p>Frank afterwards said that he experienced no
fear of any kind as the flying machine glided
upward from the earth. At first there was the
sensation of great speed, though the machine was
comparatively close to the ground, but as the
height increased that sensation diminished. Instead
of the machine seeming to rise, the earth
seemed to drop away leaving the machine stationary.
Below, the country revealed itself like
a map, with the highways and lanes standing out
sharply. To the south he got the glint of the
English Channel, and to the north was a great
black smudge which he took to be London with
its smoke from tens of thousands of chimneys.</p>

<p>"Going higher," shouted Butler. "Bad currents
down here." The words came faintly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Frank through the roaring of the wind and the
sharp crackle of the engine exhaust. The plane
plunged and rocked in an air billow.</p>

<p>"Go ahead as far as you want to," shouted
Frank, "but get me there." He had lost all sensation
of fear and almost of interest in the flight.
His mind was on Queen's Club. Steadily the machine
climbed until the green of the trees and
the grass all became as one, and the red tiles
of the roofs showed only as a splash of color
among the vast expanse of green. At the greater
height of perhaps two thousand feet, where Butler
found better currents, Frank thought the
country below seemed more than ever like a map
in one of his old school geographies. Twenty
towns and cities lay within the range of his vision
and, by turning his head slightly, he could distinguish,
across the whole width of the Channel,
the dim outlines of the shores of France.</p>

<p>The motor of the big biplane, which had been
running with the precision of a well-timed clock
for the space of half an hour, began to give
evidence of something wrong with its internals.
It skipped, stuttered in its rhythm for a moment
and then went on, only to repeat in a moment.
The aviator, helpless in this emergency, merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
jiggled his spark lever, but the stuttering of the
motor continued, and then with a most disconcerting
suddenness the motor stopped entirely.</p>

<p>"We've got to come down," shouted Butler,
"but I'll make our fall as long as possible. Hold
tight."</p>

<p>Frank needed no urging. He felt the death
of the steady forward movement and the grip
of gravity as the biplane began to drop with incredible
swiftness toward the earth. But it was
a drop which was controlled by the cool-headed
Butler, and every foot of the drop took them
nearer to their destination.</p>

<p>Five hundred feet below, Frank saw a little
patch of green field entirely free from trees or
shrubbery, and to this he rightly guessed the aviator
was heading. It looked like a golf course
from that height, and, indeed, proved to be.
Now they were directly over the haven which
Butler had picked out, and it seemed in a fair
way to pass it, when the flyer banked hard to
the left, almost pivoted on his left wing, brought
the machine around over the golf links again and,
with a final swooping spiral came to earth with a
shock sufficiently hard to snap off at the hub one
of the wheels of the biplane's running gear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV. <span class="subtit">THE MATCH AT QUEEN'S CLUB.</span></h2>

<p>"Sorry," said Butler, "I couldn't land you
where I promised, but this motor has played hob
with me. She's been acting badly for a week."</p>

<p>A score of people came running up. "Hurt,
hurt?" they cried.</p>

<p>"Hurt? no!" said Frank, "only disappointed.
We were heading for Hendon. How far is it
to Queen's Club grounds?"</p>

<p>"'Bout five miles," volunteered someone.</p>

<p>"Is there a taxicab place about here anywhere?"
inquired Frank. "I've got to get to
Queen's Club on the double quick." He looked
at his watch. It showed three minutes of two.
The games were about to begin!</p>

<p>"Butler, excuse me if I leave you," cried Frank.</p>

<p>"Go to it, boy," said Butler, "and the Lord
bless you."</p>

<p>Heading in the direction of a taxicab stand,
Frank started off on a sharp trot, but was doomed
to disappointment as not a taxi was available at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
that moment, and the man in the little office
wasn't hopeful that any would be back right
away. "They may come any minute, and there
may not be a blooming one for half an hour.
If you'll take the 'bus on the next street, it will
take you within half a mile of Queen's Club
grounds."</p>

<p>Scarcely waiting to hear the last words, Frank
darted for the street mentioned, and, after a wait
of five minutes, boarded an electric 'bus bound for
West Kensington. Fortunately, he found a seat-mate
who was well acquainted with what was going
on at Queen's Club that day.</p>

<p>"Going to see the games, I suppose," he said.
From him Frank learned that a short cut could
be made which would be of considerable help
as a time-reducer. Fixing the direction in his
mind, he sprang from the 'bus at the street indicated,
and started on a run in the general direction
of the Club.</p>

<p>As he ran, the last instructions of Trainer
Black came to his mind: "Take it easy till the
games, and keep off your feet." He could not suppress
a grim smile as he pounded along, running
flat-footed to keep as much spring as possible in
his toes if he ever reached the track and if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
was in time when he did reach there. Always he
kept an eye out for a taxi, but fate was against
him and he saw none excepting those with fares
seated therein, and whirling along on their own
business.</p>

<p>Losing his way, finding it again with the help
of passers-by, and nearly but not quite despairing
of there ever having been such a place in London
as the Queen's Club, he was halted by a college
yell, sharp and incisive, delivered comparatively
near. Getting his bearings from the direction in
which the yell came, he dashed through a short
street and stood before the main gate of the
Club.</p>

<p>"Is it over?" he panted to the officer at the
gate. "The meet&mdash;is it over?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the officer, staring at
the newcomer, whose eyes, fierce in their intensity,
looked out from a face streaked with sweat
and dirt.</p>

<p>"I'm one of the competitors," gasped Frank.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the officer, "you look it.
Did you run all the way from New York?"</p>

<p>"I <em>am one of the competitors</em>," said Frank,
emphasizing every word, "and through an accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
got left at Brighton. Please let me go to
the training quarters of the American team."</p>

<p>"Well, 'ere's a rum cove. Comes up 'ere and
wants to get passed into the gymes for nothink."</p>

<p>For a few minutes it looked as if, after all his
trouble to get to the Club grounds, he was to
be held up outside while his chance was lost.
Finally, however, he induced the officer to send
a messenger to the American quarters, and in
half a minute he was snatched through the gate
by an assistant trainer and stood in the presence
of Captain Harrington, who was just going out
for his quarter.</p>

<p>The captain looked him over with cold, hard
eyes. "You're a little late," he said. "We don't
bring men across the Atlantic to have them late
for the beginning of a track meet. You are no
value to us. We will not need you."</p>

<p>Frank opened his mouth to speak, but Harrington
interrupted sharply with "I don't want
to hear excuses," and passed on to the start of his
event. Frank did not have the heart even to look
at the race which was slated to go to the Americans
through the superior ability of the Yale
captain. Trainer Black looked up when he entered
the building, but said nothing. Frank felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as if he had been thrown into outer darkness.
He ground his teeth in impotent rage and dropped
into a chair, listening in a half-hearted way to the
little volley of spontaneous cheering which drifted
through the window.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Trainer Black, and
dashed out the door. "Sounds like an English
cheer!"</p>

<p>An English cheer it was, and it announced the
victory of a Cambridge "dark horse" who had run
the Yale quarter-mile champion off his feet in the
stretch. A minute later Harrington staggered
into the room, and threw himself face downward
on a table.</p>

<p>"This loses us the meet," said a rubber in a
whisper. "To think that Harrington should lose
out, of all people. He loafed too much in the
first part of the race and couldn't hold the sprint
at the end. It was a foxy trick the Englishman
worked, but a fair win enough."</p>

<p>"Where's Armstrong, where's Armstrong?"
came the excited call by Trainer Black.</p>

<p>Frank stood up. "Here," he said simply.</p>

<p>"Get into your clothes," Black shouted. "Why
are you sitting there like a dummy? Here, some
of you fellows help him. Patsy, rub his leg muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
a bit&mdash;Jack, help Patsy. Move lively!"</p>

<p>Frank tore off his clothes, and in half a minute
his leg muscles were being slapped and kneaded
by the two rubbers as if their life depended on
doing a quick and thorough job.</p>

<p>"It's like this," said Black, coming over to the
rubbing table. "Everything went about as scheduled
until Harrington fell down in his quarter.
That leaves us short an event we counted on."</p>

<p>"Did we get the shot?"</p>

<p>"No, confound it, that Rhodes scholar from
Dakota beat our man out on the last try."</p>

<p>"So the Englishmen have now two more than
we calculated?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, and there isn't a ghost of a chance
of their losing the two-mile run unless their men
choke."</p>

<p>"And the broad-jump?" inquired Frank,
weakly.</p>

<p>"You've got to win that!" Black said it as if
it was by no means an unusual request.</p>

<p>"Win it?" gasped Frank. "What has Vare
done?"</p>

<p>"Took only three jumps the last of which was
twenty-three feet, and hasn't jumped again. McGregor's
been dragging his tries along, hoping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that you would turn up, but he hasn't been able
to do better than twenty-two six. Armstrong, if
you can turn the trick on Vare it will give us the
meet. You've got to do it!" he added vehemently.</p>

<p>Frank rolled from the rubbing table, slipped
into his scanty track suit, and, with the Yale manager,
trotted quickly to the field. "I suppose you
are in good shape," suggested the manager hopefully.
"Were you resting and keeping off your
feet?"</p>

<p>In spite of the seriousness of the situation,
Frank could hardly restrain a grin. "Keeping
off my feet!" he thought. "If they knew what
I've been through to get here! Guess I'm all
right," he said aloud.</p>

<p>McGregor greeted Frank enthusiastically.
"Where in the name of Billy Patterson have you
been?" and then, without waiting for an answer:
"This Vare is a grasshopper. He has this event
cinched, you and I are only ornaments, not real
jumpers at all, and the Johnny Bulls have decided
they've licked the Yankees for once in their lives&mdash;look!
they're beginning to go!" Then to
Frank: "For pity's sake, let out a link and make
a good showing. I'm tied to the ground with a
bag of lead in each heel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank did not need any urging. The complacent
attitude of the Englishmen, who were beginning
to file out in groups of three or four,
their faces showing the satisfaction of sure victory,
added to his determination. He had made a
desperate struggle to be where he was now, and
he was not going to let it end there.</p>

<p>Measuring off the runway with more than ordinary
care, Vare set his marks, and, after two or
three practice runs, loped down the runway and
made his first leap.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two feet, four inches," sang out the
measurer.</p>

<p>Vare had walked to the jumping pit. A flicker
of a smile crossed his face, he nodded cheerfully
to his Cambridge jumping mate, and picking up
his jersey swung it across his shoulder, and,
without another look at the Americans, turned his
face to the track house.</p>

<p>"His Lordship Vare de Vare has published to
the world that it's all over, Frank," said McGregor.
"I'd give a good right leg if I could beat
him, he's so mighty superior. But I've only got
one more jump, and it's not in me. If you don't
want to see my poor busted heart cluttering up
this field, go after him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's now or never," said Frank to himself as
he walked slowly down the runway. "What was
it Princewell said&mdash;think high when you hit the
take-off&mdash;think high&mdash;&mdash; I'll think a mile high
if it will help!"</p>

<p>In spite of the difficulties he had undergone
in getting to the Club, he was keyed to such
a state of nervous excitement that he felt as if
he were walking on air. The hard incidents of
the morning were forgotten, the thrilling ride in
the air machine, the abrupt landing, the killing
run through torrid streets, the frigid reception of
his captain. Now, with his opportunity at hand
he became cool and calculating. He had a splendid
reserve of strength to call upon, and he would
call it to the last ounce.</p>

<p>Down the runway came Armstrong like a flash,
first slowly, then with a great burst of speed.
His eye was fixed on the take-off block, but his
mind was on that four-foot hurdle supposed to be
six feet out there in the pit. He struck the block
perfectly and, with hands thrown high in the
air and feet drawn up to clear the imaginary
hurdle, he sailed up and forward, struck at last
in the pit and held his full distance.</p>

<p>With a shout McGregor, recognizing a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
jump, sprang from the bench and ran forward
to the jumping pit from which Frank was just
stepping, brushing away the loam that clung to
his ankles.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three feet, even," the announcer
bawled.</p>

<p>Coming so unexpectedly, the announcement for
a moment fell on deaf ears. Then, as the full
significance became apparent, the Americans in
the stand set up a piercing and spontaneous yell
which startled and turned back the crowd already
moving in larger and larger numbers in the direction
of the gate.</p>

<p>"Y-e-a-a-a&mdash;Armstrong!" yelled McGregor in
a frenzy of delight, and fell upon that individual
like a long lost brother, beat him upon the back
and capered about like a man bereft of his
senses. "It means that old Claude Vare de Vare,
Lord of Creation and Elsewhere, has got to come
back and do it over again! We have a chance!
Oh, Armstrong, it means we have a chance!"</p>

<p>Interest in the stand immediately became intense.
People who were leaving returned to their
seats.</p>

<p>"A ripping jump!" commented an Englishman
as he reseated himself, "but Vare will take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
measure." Vare had been sent for, and was even
now walking calmly across the track with an attitude
which said plainly: "What's all this fuss
about anyway? We'll settle this now once and
for all."</p>

<p>A ripple of applause and hand-clapping ran
through the stands as Vare turned to face the pit
at the far end of the runway, and glanced down
the narrow way now hedged with faces. He was
a champion of champions, and would show them
how a champion jumped. But not that time, for
his best effort fell under twenty-three feet.</p>

<p>Surprised at his poor jump, he lost his composure
and, against the advice of his friends,
took a second jump without rest, and that, too,
fell below his jump of twenty-three feet.</p>

<p>The news that Armstrong had equaled Vare's
best jump spread to the locker rooms of the two
teams, and excitement ran high. What had
seemed like an event lost for a certainty to the
Americans, had in a moment been turned into a
possibility.</p>

<p>McGregor had taken his last jump without
changing the situation in any way. Thereafter
he devoted himself to encouraging Armstrong,
whose magnificent leap had raised the hopes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the whole American contingent. "You have him
now, Frank," McGregor whispered as, with arm
over Frank's shoulder, the two walked down the
runway. "He let himself get cold, and I'll bet
he can't reach twenty-three feet again."</p>

<p>But McGregor was mistaken. Vare, the champion,
after he had had more life rubbed into his
muscles, shot down the runway and cleared
twenty-three feet, one inch and a half. A little
scattering cheer from the Englishmen, and Vare
sat down on the jumpers' bench, his face showing
the relief he felt. "I'm all right now," he said
to an anxious, inquiring teammate, "but I felt
jolly well frozen those first two jumps, though."</p>

<p>"The meet," bawled the announcer, facing the
grand stand, "now stands six events for America
and six for England, with the broad-jump still
to be decided. Vare, of Oxford, has the longest
jump to his credit&mdash;twenty-three feet, one and
a half inches, which he made in breaking the tie
created by Armstrong, of Yale, with a jump of
twenty-three feet, which is <em>his</em> best at present."</p>

<p>At this moment Captain Harrington came onto
the track in street clothes. He walked up to
Frank: "Armstrong," he said, "Jack told me all
about your troubles getting here. I want to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
you you made a game fight to correct the original
mistake. I know you were personally not at
fault. Here's my hand on it!"</p>

<p>Frank took the proffered hand. His captain
had taken him back into the fold, and his heart
swelled almost to the bursting point with sudden
joy. If Frank needed anything to make him unbeatable
that afternoon, the thing had come to
pass. "I'll try to justify your faith in me," was
all he said, but his eyes shone with a new light.</p>

<p>Coming down the runway with a surpassing
rush of speed, he hit the take-off perfectly on
his next trial, and soared into the air. Spectators,
who saw him, said afterward that he seemed to
take a step at the highest point of his flight, but
it was only the first appearance of the famous
"scissors hitch" used by other great jumpers before
him, and which he had simply happened on,
in his endeavor to get great distance. He struck
squarely on his feet in almost a sitting posture,
but his impetus carried him forward so powerfully
that he pitched head-first into the soft loam
of the pit. He held every inch of his great jump,
however.</p>

<p>For it was a great jump. That could be seen
by anyone, and the officials and trackmen gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
around while a careful measurement was
taken. The serene Vare was sufficiently stirred
himself to crowd close to the pit.</p>

<p>"What is it, what is it?" snapped Harrington
who could hardly await the rather deliberate
speech of the man at the end of the steel tape,
who was taking his time to make certain.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three feet, four inches!"</p>

<p>The cheer of the small group of men on the
track itself was taken as a good omen by the
Americans in the stand, and these latter at once
delivered themselves of a full-grown yell, which
echoed back from the brick dwellings which surround
the field.</p>

<p>"Twenty-three feet, four inches!" came the announcement,
bawled to all sides of the field
through the megaphone, and again the American
yells broke out.</p>

<p>In the storm of cheering which Frank's great
jump had elicited, Vare was seen to rise to his
feet and walk slowly to the start of the runway.
Two of his teammates went with him, and at
each of his important marks he stopped and
scrutinized them carefully as if he was not sure
in his own mind that they were just right. Twice
he tried the full runway from the start to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
take-off block, making new marks for his guidance.</p>

<p>And now, being quite ready, he made his first
of the three tries allotted to him. On the first
he cleared twenty-three feet, two inches, and on
the second bettered this mark by half an inch.</p>

<p>"Only an inch and a half behind you, Armstrong,"
said McGregor, in a nervous staccato,
"but I'll eat my shoes, spikes and all, if he can
equal that one of yours."</p>

<p>"If he does," said Frank, "it's all over, I'm
afraid. How I came to get that far out is more
than I can understand. It's a dream, don't wake
me!"</p>

<p>Silence settled over the crowd as Vare faced
the pit for his last trial. His face was drawn and
white. Now he moves forward, crouching a
little, with chin out and jaws tightly clenched.
The loping run develops at half distance into a
sweeping rush, the Englishman hits the take-off
squarely, and leaps with every ounce of energy
in his body&mdash;up, up, out, out, he goes, while the
spectators at the track side hold their breaths.
Now he has reached the full height of his jump,
and is coming down. Will his drive carry him
far enough to win? He is down in the pit, topped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
over by the impetus of his rush, but the jump is
clean, and the measurers are at work.</p>

<p>Carefully the tape is placed, carefully it is
read, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Twenty-three feet, three and one-quarter
inches," comes the announcement.</p>

<p>The Americans go mad now indeed, for the
meet is won, since the Oxford champion has
failed to equal Armstrong's magnificent jump
by three-quarters of an inch, not much, it is true,
but enough to make the difference between victory
and defeat.</p>

<p>Just as the jubilation was at its height, a dusty,
grimy youth, in what were once white flannels,
rushed through the gate, and threw himself on
Frank as the latter was being escorted like a
young prince of the blood to the club house.</p>

<p>"I knew you would do it, you old lobster," cried
the newcomer, who was none other than Codfish
Gleason. "Sorry I couldn't get in at the death,
but I was arrested three times for moving too
fast for these Johnnies, and paid a five-pound
fine every time. I couldn't have gone much further
for my money was running short."</p>

<p>To say that Frank Armstrong was the hero
of the occasion is to tell only a part of the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
The youngest man on either team had achieved
the greatest glory, and his teammates were not
slow in acknowledging the fact. At the dinner
that night in London, given to members of the
four teams, Frank was called on to make a speech,
and it was the shortest on record: "I did the
best I could," after which he sat down covered
with confusion, amid loud applause.</p>

<p>The next day came the sight-seeing in London
and some of the nearby towns, and then a generous
and thankful management stood the expense
of a trip for the American winners to Amsterdam,
to Cologne, to Lausanne, where the song-birds
of the party serenaded the girls' school
there, and then to Paris, with many side trips.
But, in spite of the beauties and wonders of the
strange countries, Frank said afterward that the
best sight of all was the shores of Long Island
viewed from the deck of the homing Cunarder.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI. <span class="subtit">MAKING THE 'VARSITY NINE.</span></h2>

<p>Frank Armstrong returned to college in the
fall with a reputation. His remarkable jumping
which won the deciding event of the meet at
Queen's Club in London, and no less the picturesque
manner in which he had made his way
from Brighton that eventful day, had been spread
widely in the newspapers, and no one within reach
of the cable or telegraph but knew the details of
the story.</p>

<p>But the publicity and adulation in no way disturbed
Frank's balance. He was much too level-headed
for that, and went about his work the
most unassuming of his classmates. "Nothing
to make such a fuss about," he used to say. "I
simply had to do it. That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>The luck of the room drawings had landed
our three friends in Connecticut Hall, that century
and a half memorial to old Yale. "Comfortable
and musty," was the Codfish's comment
when he had heard the news. David Powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
had drawn a room in Welch Hall directly opposite.
It was David's secret ambition to win a
position on the Literary Magazine, and to this
end he had applied himself industriously in the
Freshman year. He succeeded in getting several
essays and a poem accepted by the august editors.
He had tried himself out, and was now going
after the coveted honor with high determination.</p>

<p>Out on the football field the annual preparation
for the great struggles with Harvard and Princeton
was going on. James Turner and Frank
Armstrong were enrolled as members of the
squad, and took their daily medicine on the second
eleven. Frank's lack of weight&mdash;he was
still only about one hundred and fifty pounds&mdash;prevented
him from competing on an even footing
with ends twenty pounds heavier, with which the
'Varsity was well supplied that year. The quarterback
position was so well filled that he despaired
of winning his way there and the
coaches, evidently of the same opinion, kept him
where he had played on the Freshman team.
Turner, on the other hand, had added weight and
was in a fair way to win a place somewhere in
the back field. Frank put in a great deal of time
under the direction of the punting coach, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
made good progress at that department of the
game, but at drop-kicking he had little opportunity.</p>

<p>"Drop-kicking isn't Yale's way of scoring,"
said Jimmy Turner one night when the day's
work was being discussed in the Connecticut Hall
room before a crackling fire of log-wood. "The
coaches want a team that can carry the ball over
the goal-line, not one that can boot it over the
cross-bar."</p>

<p>"I know it looks better to have the force drive
the other fellow back across his own goal, but
since these new rules went into effect it's mighty
seldom you ever see it in a big game. But I'm
not knocking. I'll keep at the drop-kicking and
hope for a chance."</p>

<p>But the chance for Frank did not come. In
two of the smaller games he was called in the
fourth quarter with a number of other substitutes,
and when the team play was badly disorganized
because so few regulars were in the
line. He played at end in each case and was
pulled back for the punting. Once with a good
opportunity for a field goal on the opponent's
twenty-yard line, a poor protection allowed a
lineman to get through and block the ball&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
thing which very nearly resulted in a touchdown
against Yale, for a free end picked up the loose
ball and was not brought down until he was well
into Yale's territory. While Armstrong was not
at all to blame, the general crowd saw only that
his kick was blocked and considered him unsafe
as a drop-kicker.</p>

<p>Turner won his Y in the Princeton game when
he was sent in to relieve Cummings, the right
halfback, a few minutes before the final whistle,
but Armstrong's chance didn't come. He sat
through the four quarters and saw the Yale team
win at the very end. A week later Armstrong
was among the blanketed figures on the side-lines,
who watched the struggle of Yale and Harvard
up and down the gridiron, with hopes rising and
falling as the tide turned one way or the other.
At the very end of the game, with the score
against Yale, a fumble in the Harvard back field
gave Yale possession of the ball on Harvard's
thirty-yard line. The Yale stand rose en masse
and begged for a touchdown, but two assaults
were stopped with scant advance. The coach ran
down the line, looking among his substitutes.</p>

<p>"Armstrong, get ready to go in," he said in
a quiet, tense voice, but even as Frank jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to his feet to obey the summons, the whistle blew
and the game was over.</p>

<p>"Another year coming," Frank said quietly as
Jimmy, with arm across his roommate's shoulder,
on their way from the field, protested against the
hard luck.</p>

<p>"You're pretty cheerful about it," commented
Turner, "and you deserved the chance as much
as I did."</p>

<p>"If I had been good enough, I'd have gone in
before. The coaches know what they are about.
If I ever get enough weight on me, I'll have a
better chance to make the eleven."</p>

<p>"And then you'll not be able to jump twenty-three
feet," said Turner; "for every compensation
there's some setback. That's the way of
life."</p>

<p>The Codfish was bitter in his condemnation of
the entire coaching system which did not discover
Armstrong's "supreme merit." "The idea
of not using you, Frank, when they had every
chance in that last quarter. I call it a murdering
shame! They might have pulled out the game."</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "I recognize your talent as a
musician and your loyalty as a friend and your
virtue as a gentleman, but I still think the coaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
knew their jobs, and that when they didn't send
me in they had good and sufficient reason for
it. I'm not kicking. Anyway, I have two more
chances, so what's the use of crying?"</p>

<p>The Codfish continued to growl about the "injustice"
for several days, and then, like everyone
else, forgot all about football and turned his attentions
to the future.</p>

<p>Before the fall Frank had taken occasional
dips in the pool when not overtired by the work
at the Field. Max, foreseeing a recruit for his
swimmers, took pains to encourage him, and,
later, at the suggestion of Captain Wilson of
the swimming team, Frank became a member of
the squad. After the close of the football season,
being well up in his studies and glad of the opportunity
to take up a form of athletics which
appealed to him strongly, he went at the work
with great earnestness.</p>

<p>In the try-outs Armstrong won his right to a
place on the team in the fifty and one hundred
yards, having covered these distances in good
time, and, when the intercollegiate meets came
along, he did his share in point-winning for
Yale.</p>

<p>"Armstrong," said Captain Wilson one afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
as the two were resting after a practice
spin of one hundred and fifty yards, "did you
ever try to swim a two-twenty?"</p>

<p>"Used to go more than that distance in open
water, but never in the tank. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, McGill, the Canadian university, is
sending a team down here in February. They
have two or three crackajacks up there and they
are making a little southern trip. I've just wired
them the date and I'd like to make as good a
showing as possible."</p>

<p>"We ought to be pretty good excepting in the
two-twenty," said Frank.</p>

<p>"And if you'll work for that distance we ought
to be pretty good there, too. I'll take care of the
hundred as well as I know how, and I'll let Hobbs
swim the fifty."</p>

<p>"And who swims the two-twenty for McGill?"</p>

<p>"Hopkins, the Olympic champion."</p>

<p>Frank gave a long whistle. "And so you want
me to be the goat? All right, Mr. Captain, I'll
do my best and lead the goat right up to the
altar to be sacrificed by the Olympic champion.
But to do it gracefully, I ought to have some
coaching in that distance."</p>

<p>"And you're going to get it. I've sent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Burton to come up and give us a little advice.
He was one of our best men at the distance as
well as at the hundred."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him. Taught me to swim."</p>

<p>"Really! Well, that's fine. He has the knack
of teaching, and can tell you the tricks of the
furlong if anyone can."</p>

<p>The McGill meet was only two weeks off, and
Frank began his training in earnest. Twice a
day he swam the furlong, first at a moderate
gait and then quickening the stroke until he was
traveling at good speed throughout the distance.</p>

<p>Burton came up from New York and spent a
portion of two days with him, and, before the
coaching was over, Frank had the satisfaction of
beating out his old teacher of the crawl stroke.</p>

<p>"You're too good for me now," gasped Burton
as he pulled himself out of the water at the end
of the race. "I'll have to leave you to the tender
mercies of Hopkins himself."</p>

<p>The night of the meet finally came around, and
the building was all too small to hold the hundreds
who crowded to the pool doors. Every seat
was sold long in advance and standing room was
crowded almost to suffocation. The attraction
was, of course, Hopkins, who had been taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the measure of every swimmer at his distance that
he had met, and who was heralded as the greatest
swimmer in the world over the furlong distance.</p>

<p>After Wilson had won the hundred and Hobbs
had lost the fifty-yard contest, Hopkins sauntered
carelessly from the dressing room, clad in a black
silk racing suit. He proved to be a tall and powerful
young man, heavily muscled. Alongside of
him, as the two stood perched on the pool end,
Frank looked very slender, but there was a suggestion
of concealed strength in the latter's well-rounded
limbs and of vitality and staying power
in the deep chest.</p>

<p>"Two-twenty yards even!" sang out the referee.
"Eight lengths and sixty feet. Hopkins,
the Olympic champion on the left for McGill;
Armstrong on the right for Yale. Ready! Get
set! GO!"</p>

<p>At the word, both bodies shot through the air
and hit the water like one. The champion used
a long, rather slow but powerful trudgeon which
was peculiarly mixed with the crawl in the leg
action; Armstrong used a quicker crawl, in which
the legs were scarcely bent at the knee, but were
thrashed rapidly in a very narrow angle. The
crowd expected the champion to pull away at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
once, but when the two turned at the far end of
the pool, they turned at exactly the same instant.
Down to the starting point the swimmers came,
moving with great speed, but still the Yale man
stayed with his big opponent with grim determination,
and even finished the fifty a fraction of
a second in advance of his Canadian opponent,
shooting away on the second fifty still in the lead.
Twice more the swimmers covered the length of
the tank without relative change in position.</p>

<p>And now the crowd, with nearly half the race
over, seeing that their representative was holding
his own, rose to their feet and delivered a wild
yell which echoed among the high girders of the
place, and from that time they did not cease to
yell at the game fight waged in the water below
them. At the one hundred and fifty-yard mark,
Armstrong, putting on a burst of speed, led his
great rival by five or six feet. Hopkins, who had
never changed his steady drive for a moment, now
quickened his thresh perceptibly, and in another
length of the tank had almost overhauled the
Yale man who was kicking along with every
pound of energy in his body. Armstrong still
led, but as they approached the two hundred-yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
mark, there was less than a yard separating
them.</p>

<p>"Armstrong! Armstrong! Armstrong!"
yelled the crowd.</p>

<p>But the boy who was causing all the excitement
was not conscious of anything but a dull
roaring in his head. The noise of the cheering
came to him faintly, much more faintly than the
splash, splash of Hopkins's arms just behind him,
and, even as he looked out of the corner of a
water-filled eye, the relentless Canadian drew up
nearer and still nearer.</p>

<p>"Sixty feet to go!" Frank heard in a dull sort
of way the official's voice. Could he do it, that
impossible distance? His throat was parched and
his chest seemed bursting with the strain of the
pumping heart. Could he live for sixty feet
more? It was a thousand miles. Summoning
every last ounce of will pressure, he drove ahead
blindly, following mechanically the swimming
lines on the pool bottom with no help from smarting
eyes. Somewhere near was Hopkins, he could
feel the swirl of water from his powerful arm
drives, but whether Hopkins was ahead or behind
he could not tell. His arms were like lead,
his legs paralyzed. A great weariness settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
upon him, a great and compelling burden which
benumbed all the faculties of brain and body.</p>

<p>About fifteen minutes later Frank found himself
lying on a couch in the room of the 'Varsity
swimming team, with several anxious faces looking
down at him, among them that of Hopkins.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked in a bewildered
way.</p>

<p>"Nothing, 'cepting you drowned yourself," said
Captain Wilson, "dead as a door nail."</p>

<p>"Did I finish?" he asked very weakly.</p>

<p>"You certainly did, you finished the race and
yourself at the same time. Two of us had to go
to the bottom for you," said the Captain. "You
sank like a stone."</p>

<p>"That's where I went to sleep, then?"</p>

<p>"I guess so, you had us scared, I tell you."</p>

<p>"You gave me a great race, Armstrong," said
Hopkins, "one of the hardest I ever had. It
wasn't record time, but it was as fast as the two-twenty
is generally done. I only won by a few
inches, and mighty lucky to get it at that," admitted
the Canadian generously.</p>

<p>"If I made you work, I'm satisfied," said Frank
weakly. "I hadn't a ghost of a chance to win, but
I set out to make you work for your victory."</p>

<p>"And you did," returned Hopkins laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII. <span class="subtit">THE SOUTHERN TRIP.</span></h2>

<p>"Congratulations to our noble little pitcher,"
cried the Codfish. "I see you are drafted for
honors on the Southern trip."</p>

<p>It was mid-March and the baseball work
in the cage was over. The 'Varsity nine had
been at work on the open field for nearly a week,
and Frank Armstrong as well as Jimmy Turner
were members of the squad. Frank had shown
possibilities as a pitcher, while Turner was considered
a substitute catcher in second or third
place. The occasion for Gleason's congratulations
was the announcement in the <em>News</em> that not
only Turner but Armstrong as well was among
those selected to make the trip always taken to the
South by the 'Varsity nine for practice at the
time of the Easter vacation.</p>

<p>Frank Quinton, a new graduate coach, who
had taken charge of the baseball situation, had
been attracted by Armstrong's earnestness and
his peculiar ability to put the ball over the plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and had undertaken with some success to teach
him the art of curving the ball and at the same
time retaining his control. Under the new coach's
guidance the pitcher had done particularly well,
and it was no surprise to anyone that he was
included among the twenty players who were
slated to make the trip. His chief competitors
were Gilbert, a Junior, and Martin, a Senior,
both more experienced in the box, but neither of
first class quality. Appleton, the pitcher of the
'Varsity the year before, had graduated, and on
these three named the hopes of the Yale team
centered.</p>

<p>"And is our old friend, the trouble maker,
coming along with us?" inquired Turner.</p>

<p>"Bettcher life," returned the Codfish. "Things
might run too smoothly if I stayed at home."</p>

<p>"You certainly can be depended upon to add a
little dash of pepper wherever you are," said
Frank laughing.</p>

<p>"You have no cause to complain, old fel," retorted
Gleason. "If I hadn't got you two thousand
feet in the air last summer you could never
have won your broad-jump, nor have had the
chance to have your picture printed in the papers
with the story of your sweet young life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps all that excitement did help," said
Frank, "but in the future we will take no more
chances in an airship."</p>

<p>"I'll promise you that much anyway," returned
the Codfish, "but just the same I think a good
deal of credit is due to your humble servant for
that victory last July. Of course, I don't expect
any credit for it from the unthinking public or
my selfish roommates, but I have my own congratulations
anyway."</p>

<p>"And that's a lot," laughed Frank. "Do you
go down with the team?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all arranged, tickets, Pullman, boat,
everything. I'm one of that noble band of 'heelers'
who brave everything to be a supporter and
lend a yell in the hostile country when most
needed."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Codfish," cried Turner. "We
may need you, but leave your automobile at
home."</p>

<p>The itinerary of the southern trip included
Washington, where the tour opened with a game
with Georgetown; Charlottesville, Va.; Richmond
and Norfolk. At the latter place three games
were to be played, then was to follow a boat trip
up the Chesapeake Bay to Washington, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
second game was to be played with Georgetown.</p>

<p>Everyone was looking forward to the delights
of warm sun and spring breezes in the land of
flowers, for the March winds on Yale field had
been anything but conducive to good ball playing.
But spring was reluctant even in the south,
and warm days were few and far between. Yale
lost the first game with Georgetown with Martin
in the box, and fared no better with the University
of Virginia nine when Gilbert, who was supposed
to be the most effective of the Yale staff
of pitchers, went down before the fusillade of
hits.</p>

<p>"You will start the game with the Norfolk
League team to-morrow," said Coach Quinton to
Armstrong as the players were leaving the dinner
table at the hotel in Norfolk. "This will be one
of the best games of the trip and I want to win
it."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," returned Frank. "I'll do my
best."</p>

<p>Frank won his game, but at heavy expense.
For five innings he pitched great ball and kept
the league hitters to two runs, while the Yale
team, finding themselves, batted out seven runs
by clean hitting and fast base-running. Then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the sixth Frank began to slow up and the Norfolk
batters reached his delivery frequently, but runs
were cut off by superb playing of the Yale infield.
Every ball he pitched sent a sting through
his muscles with a pain almost unbearable, but
he kept on to the end of the inning.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" inquired the
coach as he came to the bench. "Is your arm
bothering you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, something seems to be wrong with it.
Hurts like thunder."</p>

<p>Quinton knew only too well the symptoms.
Armstrong had "thrown his arm out," a not uncommon
thing in early spring baseball. His muscles,
not sufficiently worked out, had been injured
in the delivery of the speed ball he had been pitching.</p>

<p>Martin finished the game and held it safely,
but Frank pitched no more that trip nor during
the season for the 'Varsity. For a time after
returning to New Haven he was worked in the
outfield, but even there was at a disadvantage
because he could not shoot the ball on a long
throw from the outfield. So he was displaced by
a weaker hitter, and shortly after went over to
the track squad where he was received with open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
arms by the trainer, who foresaw a certainty of
added points in the coming track meets.</p>

<p>And he was not disappointed, for Frank, now
out of baseball because of his accident, gave his
entire time to the perfection of the broad jump,
and won first place at the Harvard and Princeton
dual meets. He took second place to the great
Moffatt who made the trip across the continent
from the University of California, and set a
mark at twenty-three feet nine inches, which
even Frank's unusual skill failed to equal, although
on three different trials he had improved
on his jump at the Queen's Club in London. Armstrong
was now rated as one of the best jumpers
in any of the colleges. But his ambitions in the
direction of baseball and football had failed to
materialize through accidents of one sort or another.
He was the kind of a boy, however, who
was willing to do as well as it was possible the
thing that was available without repining about
the things impossible.</p>

<p>During the stay at Norfolk the Codfish sustained
his reputation as a friend of trouble. On
the way down from Washington he had scraped
acquaintance with a classmate named Chalmers,
who had some acquaintances in Norfolk. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
party was hardly established at the hotel when
Gleason hunted up his friend Chalmers and suggested
that they take a ride in one of the snappy
looking motor cars that stood in front of the hotel
for hire. Chalmers pleaded poverty.</p>

<p>"Only four dollars an hour," said Gleason,
"and we can look all over the town. Bully old
place, all wistaria and pretty girls and happy
darkies. Come on, don't be a tight wad!"</p>

<p>"Four dollars an hour would break me. At
that price I could ride about ten minutes. Let's
walk," suggested Chalmers.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, let's show these southerners
some speed. I have fifteen dollars in my inside
pocket. There's a perfectly ripping blue car out
front with a darky all fussed up to beat the
band. It looks like a private rig and all that.
One hour will do the trick, and I'll foot the bill."</p>

<p>That argument moved Chalmers, whose
finances were low. Together the boys located
the blue motor car with its snappy driver, immediately
after lunch, and tumbled into the tonneau.</p>

<p>"Where do you-all want to go?" inquired the
driver.</p>

<p>"Oh, just show us around," said the Codfish,
with a wave of the hand. "Show us all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
flossy streets and the monuments, but I warn
you now I don't climb any of them. Fire away."</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the driver headed his machine
in the direction of Ghent, threading the
streets of the quaint old town while the boys
lay back luxuriously on the cushions of the tonneau.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz," said Chalmers, as the blue car
rolled down Boissevain avenue, "there's Miss
Smith or I'm an Injun."</p>

<p>"Where, who and what?" inquired the Codfish,
immediately alert.</p>

<p>"Just coming down the steps of that white
house over there."</p>

<p>"Know her?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Kid sister's roommate at school or
something like that. Been at our house once.
Promised Sis I'd look her up, but didn't expect
to have time."</p>

<p>"Gee, but she's a pippin," said the Codfish,
enthusiastically. "Let's ask her to take a ride
in our pretty blue car!"</p>

<p>"And thereby kill two birds with one stone."</p>

<p>"Which two?"</p>

<p>"Keep my promise to Sis and do a humane act.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
She lives miles from here I know. Probably been
calling."</p>

<p>"Poor thing, we ought out of common courtesy
ask her to ride home. I hate to see so pretty a
girl walking with nothing better than a dog for
company. Go ahead, be a gent; have a heart!"</p>

<p>By this time the car had traveled a block or
so beyond where they had passed Miss Smith,
whose steps were bent in the opposite direction
to that in which the boys were headed. Chalmers
was finally convinced by the persuasive Codfish
that the automobile should be offered to the young
lady, and the driver was ordered to turn around.
The pedestrian was soon overtaken, and, hat in
hand, Chalmers sprang from the car and intercepted
the young lady.</p>

<p>"Miss Smith, I believe?" he said, advancing
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Chalmers, I'm so glad to see you.
Your sister wrote me you were coming down,
but I never thought you would remember me."</p>

<p>"How could I ever forget?" said Chalmers,
making his most elaborate, and what he considered
fetching, bow. "This is my friend Mr.
Gleason of Yale."</p>

<p>"So glad to meet Mr. Gleason," chirped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
young lady. "And you-all are down with the
Yale team? Isn't that too lovely?"</p>

<p>Neither of the boys could see just how it was
"too lovely," but they took it for what it was
worth.</p>

<p>"Will you permit us to drive you home?" said
the Codfish, waving his hand magnificently toward
the blue motor car. "Chalmers says you
live miles from here."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be too lovely," gurgled Miss
Smith. "I just adore motoring, and it is such a
nice day, too. I live only a mile from here, but
it would be sweet to ride that far in your car."</p>

<p>Miss Smith was escorted to the blue motor, and
established in the middle of the rear seat while
Chalmers and Gleason took seats on either side
of her. The bull terrier, not nearly so much
pleased with motoring as his mistress, spread
himself over the floor and occasionally made
frolicsome dashes at Gleason's Yale blue silk
socks, a large expanse of which was showing.</p>

<p>"Get out, you little beast," cried Gleason,
alarmed for the welfare of his beautiful socks.
"Chew Chalmers over there, he's much better
chewing than I am."</p>

<p>"O, don't mind him, Mr. Gleason, he just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
adores blue. I simply can't keep anything blue
around the house. Always eats it up."</p>

<p>"Well, he can't eat any of my blue stuff. He
must be a Harvard dog; quit it, Fido," as the
dog made another dash.</p>

<p>A few minutes' drive brought them to Miss
Smith's house. "O, I simply don't want to get
out," she said.</p>

<p>"Then why do you?" queried the Codfish. "It
pains us to have you leave. We were just looking
around, you know, and would like to have
someone point out the sights of your gay and
festive city."</p>

<p>"That would be too lovely, and I'll be so glad
if you'll take Cousin Mary."</p>

<p>"Cousin Mary is on," said the Codfish.
"Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"O, just around the corner. She loves motoring,
too, and we poor people down here can't have
automobiles of our own."</p>

<p>It was but a minute's trip to Cousin Mary's,
and matters were facilitated by discovering the
young lady in question standing in her doorway,
hatted and gloved, with a camera in her hand.
She was more than plump, she was decidedly fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and had red hair. The Codfish decided he wasn't
for Cousin Mary. Introductions were quickly
made and the call explained. Cousin Mary was
willing to ride anywhere so long as it was in a
motor.</p>

<p>"Now where shall we go?" inquired the Codfish.
"You tell us. This will be a personally
conducted tour, you know."</p>

<p>"O, it would be just too lovely to drive to Virginia
Beach," gushed Miss Smith.</p>

<p>Chalmers, who knew something of the geography
of the territory, winced and tried to catch
his companion's eye, but that individual failed
to see the warning glance, and ordered&mdash;"Drive
to Virginia Beach, James."</p>

<p>"All right, sah," and the machine shot off for
the Beach. Chalmers very generously took the
seat alongside the driver, leaving the Codfish
with the girls in the tonneau, which was a disposition
highly satisfactory to the latter. But
he took care to put Cousin Mary on the far side
of the seat.</p>

<p>As mile after mile was spun off, and still the
destination was not reached, the Codfish began to
wonder what the length of the drive might be,
but his pride forbade him to ask. On and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
went the car at an easy pace. They had been out
nearly two hours from the hotel, and the Codfish
began to make mental calculations. "Two
hours, that makes eight dollars," he calculated,
"another hour and a half back, that makes fourteen.
That makes some little bill. I can readily
see I'm busted already!" His conversation began
to halt, but the lovely Miss Smith was concerned
only in the beauties of the landscape which
she pointed out to her companion on the seat,
who was not so deeply interested as he might
have been had things been different.</p>

<p>At last the car drew up at the Beach. "How
far do you call it down here, James?" inquired
the Codfish, nonchalantly. He was still calculating.</p>

<p>"I reckon about twenty-five miles," said the
driver. "Kaint make much time on these here
roads."</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed that," returned the Codfish
dryly.</p>

<p>The young ladies were overjoyed to be at the
Beach. They walked on the sands and took photographs.</p>

<p>"Cousin Mary just loves to take photographs,"
Miss Smith explained. Then the girls discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
they had a call to make&mdash;would Mr. Chalmers
and Mr. Gleason mind? A very dear girl friend
whom they hadn't seen for a whole month was
at the Beach. Would they come? No, then they
would only be gone a few minutes. It was "too
lovely" to have such a chance to call.</p>

<p>So the boys were left behind to wait impatiently.
The minutes passed and then more minutes.</p>

<p>"And there's that blooming motor sitting there
at four dollars an hour," growled the Codfish.
"Three hours and fifteen minutes gone already.
I'm bankrupt now and twenty-five miles to go
back. I'll be entirely insolvent by the time we
turn up in Norfolk."</p>

<p>Fifty minutes more passed and Miss Smith
and Cousin Mary reappeared on the scene only
to exhaust another reel of films photographing
the car, the pavilion, a decrepit boat drawn up
on the sands, and several sea views. "Cousin
Mary is so artistic," explained Miss Smith. "You
ought to see some of her sea views, they are
just too sweet."</p>

<p>"I've enough sea views to last me the rest of
my natural life," muttered the Codfish under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
his breath. "I'm not much for sea views at four
dollars an hour."</p>

<p>When everything necessary and unnecessary
that the girls could think of had been done, the
motor was turned in the direction of Norfolk,
and set off at, a leisurely pace much to the disgust
of the Codfish. The longer the driver took to
cover the distance, the more money he made.
Time was money to him with a vengeance.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of Norfolk, and just as dusk
was beginning to settle, the rear shoe gave way
with a loud explosion.</p>

<p>"How long?" inquired the Codfish, laconically.</p>

<p>"I reckon 'bout twenty minutes," replied the
driver, at which Miss Smith set up a remonstrance.
"We must be home. Mother will think
something dreadful has happened. The trolley
is only a few blocks from here. We can't wait
that long for him to fix the old tire."</p>

<p>"All right, then," said the Codfish. "We'll all
go, and James, you see us at the hotel after you
get fixed up again." He was glad of the opportunity
to have the automobile white elephant
off his hands, and saw a chance of getting to
the hotel and preserving his dignity before the
girls. He could get the money he needed as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
as he got back. But his luck was against him
in the shape of the darky driver who was both
obstinate and suspicious.</p>

<p>"Kaint do dat, sah," the driver protested, "last
time I do dat, I done get stung. We done been
out five hours and a half, dat makes twenty-two
dollars, not countin' little something you gwine to
give James."</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Gleason," cried Miss Smith. "I
thought it was your own car." There was a note
of reproach in her voice, and the speaker tossed
her head. A ride in a hired car didn't seem so
luxurious as in a private one.</p>

<p>A hasty conference between the two boys resulted
in the pooling of all their cash in hand,
which amounted to just $16.25. This amount the
Codfish offered the driver, who refused it and
loudly argued for his rights before a gathering
crowd. He would not let his passengers out of
his sight, so it was finally arranged that Chalmers
should see the young ladies home while he,
the Codfish, held as a hostage, hung around for
another half hour while the shoe was replaced.
He reached the hotel late for dinner, where he
borrowed sufficient money to pay the driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the story got out, and the two
participants never heard the last of it. It was
even resurrected in the class day histories at
the end of Senior year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII. <span class="subtit">FOOTBALL IN JUNIOR YEAR.</span></h2>

<p>After college closed Frank Armstrong and
Jimmy Turner joined a party of engineers and
their assistants, whose work it was to survey a
new railroad through the heart of New Brunswick,
one of the Maritime provinces of Canada,
and for two months they enjoyed the life of
veritable savages in the open air. Following the
pointing finger of the compass they burrowed
through the tangled forests, sleeping sometimes
rolled in blankets with a bunch of fragrant hemlock
boughs for a pillow, and, only when the
weather was bad, under the protecting service
tents, several of which had been brought along
for bad weather. Many nights, however, the
tents were never set up at all, and the whole party
of young men slept with only the stars for their
roof. Frank made himself invaluable at river
crossings, of which there were many, for bridges
were few and far between. It was his duty to
swim the barring river with the engineers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
"chains" which he did with such success that
he was nicknamed "the torpedo." Later he was
followed by other members of the party on homemade
catamarans.</p>

<p>The life agreed with both the boys, and when
the party finished its work and took train at the
little station of Harcourt on the Intercolonial
railroad, with clothing ragged from the rough
caress of the tangled woods and shoes guiltless
of blacking, they might well have been mistaken
for young lumbermen instead of college students.</p>

<p>Ten days later they were in football clothes on
Yale field, obeying the call for early fall practice
before college opened. Frank had put on ten
pounds during the summer, and for the first
time felt himself strong enough to withstand the
punishing work of the game. He was hard as
nails, in perfect condition and eager for any
work the coach might set him at. Again he was
placed at end in practice by Coach Hanley, and
made such good progress that in the middle of
the first game he was called in to play the position,
where he acquitted himself with such credit
that he earned a word of praise from Captain
Baldwin.</p>

<p>Through the long, hard grueling work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
fall he fought for his place, alternating between
the 'Varsity and the second eleven, learning
something every day under the tuition of this
or that coach for the purpose of helping Yale
turn out a winning team. Turner was firmly
established at right halfback, and gave promise
of becoming a great player. His irresistible
smashes earned many yards for Yale in the
minor games of the season, and it was a common
prediction that he would be first choice for
the place in the championship games. He succeeded
not by any great speed but by his instinct
for the opening his linemen made and his almost
uncanny ability to keep his feet and burrow for
a gain through the worst tangle of human bodies.
It was Turner who was always given the ball
down near the goal line to carry it across, and he
rarely failed to accomplish his end.</p>

<p>The uncertainty regarding who was to play
right end was banished in the Brown game which
preceded the Princeton game by one week. The
game was a hard one, and neither side could
score a touchdown. Frank was called in at right
end to replace Saunders, and on the second line-up
took a well delivered forward pass and scored
with practically a free field. Twice again before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the game was over he proved his ability in this
particular play. His baseball helped him in the
handling of the football, and his speed and
elusiveness in an open field added to his chances.
It was therefore no surprise to anyone in the
college when he was slated to go in the first line-up
against Princeton.</p>

<p>"I'm putting you in, Armstrong," said Coach
Hanley, "in spite of the fact that Saunders has
had more experience. In other words, I'm taking
a chance with you. Don't fall down. This
Princeton team has a strong line and we've got
to fox them with the forward pass. Keep cool,
and use your head all the time."</p>

<p>The instructions sounded easy enough, but
when Frank took his place at right end on the
day of the game, under the eyes of thirty thousand
people, to say that he was nervous expressed
only a small part of his feelings. While the big
Yale center placed the ball at midfield for the
kick-off he lived, like other high-strung players
before him, what seemed a whole year of his
lifetime. He was almost overcome by the sudden
fear that he might not be able to do what
was expected of him, and the barking cheers from
the Yale side of the field added to his nervousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
instead of encouraging him. Twice Biddle,
the center, placed the ball, and twice the stiff
breeze topped it over. Frank's heart was pounding,
and he felt weak and ineffective, but at the
shrill scream of the whistle, and as the ball rose
in the air and soared off in the direction of
Princeton's goal, his mind cleared like a flash.
He regained his grip on himself, and sped off
down the field like the wind, feeling a moment
later the grim joy of shock and strain as his arms
closed around the legs of the man with the ball,
who came sweeping up the field, behind what
seemed like a wall of interference. How he
reached the runner, he never knew, but the fact
that he had reached him seemed to give him the
strength of ten men.</p>

<p>Twice the Princeton backs were shot at his
end. Once he got the runner, and the second
time he spilled the interference, leaving Turner
to take the man with the ball, which he did with
a jolting tackle that jarred the Princeton man's
very being.</p>

<p>Up and down the field surged the tide of battle,
while the stands under the urging of the
cheer-leaders gave out on the one side or the
other an almost steady roar of cheers. In spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of their volume they seemed strangely far away
to the players whose energies were engaged entirely
with the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Once the new right end was drawn in, and a
Princeton back slipped around him for fifteen
yards. The sharp reprimand from the captain
was not necessary for he was raging at himself,
savage at being tricked. A moment later he was
tricked again: the back made a feint at the end,
went inside him and was stopped by Turner.</p>

<p>"That's the place," yelled a Princeton coach,
"put it there again!" It looked like a weak place
indeed, and the Princeton quarter, after making
his distance on the other side of the line, again
shot his catapult at right end.</p>

<p>This time Frank went through the interference,
and tackled so viciously that there were
hisses from a few in the Princeton stand. He
was fighting mad, crazy to hurt and to be hurt.
Again and again he hurled himself blindly
against the Princeton onrush only to be borne
backwards.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized what the matter was.
The coach's words came to him: "Keep cool,
play your game and keep your head working."
It was like a dash of cold water, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
immediately cool. He had a grip on himself in
a moment, and he now smiled back into the mocking
eyes of his opposing end where a moment before
he had glared in hate. He had obtained the
mastery over himself.</p>

<p>Again the play swung around to his end, but
this time he met it coolly and deliberately, and
checked it without the gain of a foot, while the
Yale stand announced its approval with a mighty
and spontaneous shout. Time after time the
Princeton attack at the right end was met and
turned back, and Saunders, who had been told
to get ready to replace Armstrong, sat down
again at the motion of Coach Hanley, and
wrapped his blankets around his shoulders. This
much Frank saw out of the corner of his eye,
and a thrill of satisfaction went through him.
He had learned his lesson and was making good.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to tell the story of
Frank's baptism of fire, nor how the two evenly
matched teams battled to a tie at the end of four
desperately fought periods. Frank played
through three of these periods, and although he
played well and did all of his duty, he never had
a clear chance at a forward pass. The ball was
thrown either too far or not far enough on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
half dozen tries at the pass, or the attempt to
throw was spoiled by the eager Princeton forwards
who crowded through the line. At the
end of the third quarter he was taken out weak
and staggering from his exertions, and Saunders
went in.</p>

<p>But the coach's "All right, Armstrong," was
music to his ears as he came over to the side-line
to be immediately wrapped in a big blanket
by the trainer.</p>

<p>That night, while the team was dressing in the
Gymnasium, the coaches gave the men the benefit
of some advice. "You fellows forgot most of
the time," said Hanley, "that you were a team.
You were playing every man for himself. You
should have licked that Princeton team, and the
only reason you didn't was that you were not a
Yale team. We don't want brilliant individual
stuff. One must help the other. If you get together
before next Saturday we can beat Harvard.
If you play as you did to-day, Harvard
will lick you out of your boots, because she has
a great team and it is together. You are just
as good, but you are not together." It was
straight talk, and it sank deep.</p>

<p>Monday was a day of rest at the field, but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Tuesday the final preparation for Harvard began.
Behind locked gates under the urgings of
the half a score of coaches who had hurried to
New Haven, the previous practice and even
the Princeton game were like child's play. Armstrong
was at right end, a position which he had
fairly won, but Saunders on the Second eleven
fought tooth and nail to displace him. It seemed
to Frank that the Second eleven coaches had a
particular grudge at his end, for he was called
upon to stop more than his share of attacks. But
he was able to do what was expected of him,
backed up as he was by the sturdy and omnipresent
Turner who withstood everything with
a never-failing energy.</p>

<p>Wednesday's practice, fiercer than the day before,
if that could be, found Frank Armstrong
still in possession of his place at right end, but
it was with a sigh of relief that he heard the
welcome "That's all," of Coach Hanley. He
watched with interest the usual celebration of the
Second eleven which marks the end of the year's
practice.</p>

<p>On Thursday the 'Varsity, with substitutes, a
score of coaches and heelers, took the afternoon
train to the north, and were quartered at a hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
just outside of Cambridge. A brief signal practice
was held in the towering Stadium on Soldiers
Field Friday, where the last instructions were
given to the men. It would be too much to say,
and not the truth, that the night was a peaceful
one for most of the Yale eleven. Turner and
Armstrong were quartered in separate beds in
the same room. The former slept like a log, apparently
free from all thoughts of the morrow.
Frank, on the other hand, tossed and turned, got
up in the night and sat at the window while his
companion snored contentedly. In the early
hours of the morning he finally dropped into a
sleep which was disturbed by dreams of the Harvard
runners slipping past just beyond his reach.
How he got through the morning he never knew,
but he did get through somehow, and finally
found himself dressed for the fray and in the big
'bus with the rest of the eleven, headed for the
Stadium.</p>

<p>"There go the Yaleses!" sang out an urchin.</p>

<p>"Dey won't look so nice as dat when de Harvards
get through wit' dem," shouted his companion.</p>

<p>Occasionally the 'bus passed Yale sympathizers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and then it got a cheer or: "Go to it, Yale,
you're the boys who can do it!"</p>

<p>From every direction throngs of people were
heading toward the great concrete structure
whose huge gray bulk seemed to fill the horizon.
Already thousands swarmed in its arches, and
even at this hour little black specks of human
beings were seen outlined on its upper heights
against the sky. Progress became slower as the
'bus neared the field, and it finally took the
combined efforts of a squad of police to break
the crowd sufficiently to let the Yale players
through to the Locker Building within the
shadow of the Stadium walls.</p>

<p>The game was to be started at two o'clock, and
at a quarter of that hour it would have been difficult
to find a vacant place in all those towering
tiers. Yale occupied the south and Harvard
the north side of the field. The cheer-leaders
were tuning up, as it were. Back and forth
across the field were flung songs and cheers, and
in this lull before the battle each applauded the
other's efforts.</p>

<p>Five minutes before the hour the Harvard captain,
with his red-jerseyed and red-stockinged
warriors at his heels, dashed through the gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
at the northwest corner of the field. A great
wave of crimson seemed to sweep the Harvard
stand from end to end as the thirty thousand
Harvard sympathizers rose to their feet, waving
flags and red bandannas. A crackling cheer like
musketry rolled across the field. While the Harvard
cheer-leaders called for a cheer for the
team, the Yale stand sat motionless. A minute
later, however, it sprang into life as Captain
Baldwin led his men onto the field through the
same gate at a loping run. The Yale crowd was
smaller, but what a noise it did make!</p>

<p>After a few minutes of signal practice, the two
captains with the officials met at the center of the
field and tossed for choice of sides. The coin
which was flipped in the air by the referee fell
heads, which was the side Captain Randall of
Harvard, had called, and he indicated with a
sweep of his hand that he would take the west
end of the field. What little wind was then blowing
at his back was the only advantage he had.
Both elevens quickly dropped into their places,
the whistle shrilled and the game was on.</p>

<p>That was a game which went down in history
as one of the fiercest and hardest ever played
between the two old rivals. It was clean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
free from bad feeling which sometimes marks
close games, but intense from the first line-up to
the last. Harvard, after receiving the ball on
the kick-off, cut loose a smashing attack through
the line, reeling off the yards with terrible, tremendous
force, a force that Yale did not seem
to be able to meet successfully.</p>

<p>Down over the white lines went the Harvard
machine, plays timed to perfection and gaining
wherever they struck, not much, but enough in
three tries to carry them the necessary yards
for a first down. A perfect roar of cheers boiled
up from the Harvard side of the field while
Yale seemed paralyzed. Only after the ball had
been pushed well into Yale territory did her
cheer-leaders begin to get something like a cheer
of volume.</p>

<p>But Yale was learning, and before Harvard
had progressed to the danger zone the advance
was stopped, and Yale took the ball, an act that
was approved by a mighty cheer.</p>

<p>Turner bored through for eight yards on the
first play, and followed it up with enough to
make a first down, but there the advance stopped.
Porter, the Yale fullback, who was doing the
punting, was hurried by the rush of the Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
forwards, and his kick almost blocked. It traveled
diagonally across the field for a bare fifteen-yards
gain, and was Harvard's ball.</p>

<p>"Now stop 'em right here! Take it away,"
commanded Captain Baldwin. "You can do it!"</p>

<p>But Harvard was not to be stopped just then.
Playing like red demons, they fought their way
foot by foot into Yale's territory, and threatened
the Yale goal. Turner and Armstrong
were on the bottom of every heap when the play
came at their side, but the best they could do was
to keep the gains down. They could not entirely
stop them. But the gallant Yale line rallied less
than ten yards from their goal, and again checked
the crimson attack. So determined were the
Harvard team to make a touchdown that they
scorned to try a field goal, and depended on a
forward pass to make the necessary distance.</p>

<p>Armstrong, alert for just such a move, intercepted
the ball and again it was Yale's. Yale's
rushing attack was stopped short and Porter was
sent back to punt.</p>

<p>"Block it! block it! block it!" yelled the Harvard
partisans but although the red line tried
desperately to do this, Porter succeeded in getting
his kick off, but the ball went high, was held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
back by the wind which at that moment was
blowing a stiff breeze, and it dropped into the
Harvard quarter's hands a bare twenty yards
back of his line of scrimmage. A groan went up
from the Yale hosts as Harvard, for the third
time, took up the march down the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX. <span class="subtit">THE HARVARD-YALE GAME.</span></h2>

<p>Yale's defense stiffened and made her opponent's
going become harder. With five yards to
go for a first down, the Harvard quarter and his
right end executed a neat forward pass which
put the ball on Yale's twelve-yard line directly
opposite the posts, and one smash at right tackle
put it three yards nearer the goal line.</p>

<p>"Touchdown! touchdown! touchdown!" begged
the Harvard stand.</p>

<p>"Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em!" pleaded Yale,
but the pleading was of no avail, for that splendid
Harvard team, working like a well-oiled piece of
machinery, drove on and over their opponents
till the ball lay only three yards away from the
goal. A touchdown seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>Captain Baldwin drew his men together in a
little group and exhorted them to such good purpose
that the next charge was stopped dead in its
tracks. Again the lines faced each other, again
came the crash of body meeting body. The Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
back with the ball tucked under his arm
shot off to the left, slipped inside his own tackle
and was clear of the first line of defense. But
as he straightened up from his running crouching
position, Turner met him with a bull-like
rush, picked him clear off his feet and threw him
with such violence that the ball flew from his
grasp and bounced crazily along the ground in
the direction of the goal. Man after man took
a diving shot at it as it rolled until the turf was
covered with sprawling figures. Finally the ball
disappeared beneath a mass of bodies which the
referee slowly dug apart and found&mdash;Frank
Armstrong wrapped around the ball in a loving
embrace!</p>

<p>"Yale's ball," was the silent announcement of
the scoreboard, but never was an announcement
before or since greeted with such a yell.</p>

<p>From that moment the tide of battle turned.
Porter got off a long, low twisting punt which
caught the Harvard backfield man napping. He
made a desperate effort to reach it, but although
he got his hands on the ball he could not hold it,
and was swept away by a blue avalanche. When
the smoke cleared away, Captain Baldwin was
lying on the ball on Harvard's forty-yard line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Before the teams could line up again, the whistle
blew to end the quarter and the teams changed
ends of the field.</p>

<p>Three minutes later the game was on again,
this time with Yale the aggressor and Harvard
on the defensive. Conditions of the first quarter
were reversed and now it was Yale, the team
fighting like one man, who was pushing her opponents
steadily down the field. Held at the
thirty-yard line with three yards to go for a first
down, the Yale quarter sent a pretty forward
pass to Armstrong who made a beautiful catch
and was not downed till he was run out of bounds
at the fifteen-yard line. Pandemonium reigned
among the Yale hosts, and the cheer-leaders tried
vainly to get a unison cheer. The crowd would
not look but kept their eyes glued on the play.</p>

<p>Now it was Yale's turn to call for a touchdown,
and the tiered thousands did it right lustily,
but unfortunately, for their hopes, a bad pass
on the next play lost five yards and Turner was
stopped on the next attempt.</p>

<p>"Armstrong back!" cried the quarter.</p>

<p>Frank left his place at end and took up his
position fifteen yards back of the line of scrimmage,
measuring carefully the distance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
goal posts, thirty-five yards away, while the
crowd waited in breathless silence. The
lines crouched tense and ready. The ball
shot back from Biddle on a long pass
to Frank but it came so low that he had
almost to pick it from the ground. Quick as a
flash he straightened up, dropped the ball to the
ground, and drove his toe against it as it rose
again. Away it spun on its course, while the
eyes of forty thousand people strained after its
flight. But luck was against Yale that day. The
ball, traveling straight and true, had not been
given quite enough power. It struck the cross-bar,
bounced high in the air and fell back into
the playing field where a Harvard back pounced
upon it. Harvard punted on the kick-out over
forty-five yards and after several exchanges without
result, the half ended and the tired players
tramped slowly off to the Locker House to be
told by the coaches why they had not done their
work just right.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the game was on again,
but not with its first fierceness. No human beings
could continue the pace set in that first half, and
the play settled into a punting duel between Porter
and his opponent, with neither team able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
gain much by straight rushing. Both tried forward
passes but with a few exceptions they
failed for one reason or another. The quarter
passed without either team threatening the
other's goal, and predictions were beginning to be
made that barring accidents the game would be
a tie.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the fourth period began,
a fumbled punt by the Yale quarter and a recovery
by an alert Harvard end shifted the battle
with jarring suddenness into Yale territory, with
Yale on the defensive. Again the Harvard machine
began to work with its first smoothness and
down, down they drove the ball in spite of a
desperate defense.</p>

<p>Held at the ten-yard line, the Harvard quarter,
who in the early season had been heralded as a
great drop-kicker but who had shown nothing of
his ability in late games, dropped back ten or
twelve yards behind his line and put the ball
between the posts with neatness and dispatch.
When the tumult, which the field goal had
brought to pass in the Harvard stands, quieted
down again Yale set out to win back the points
lost. But it seemed like a hopeless task, for Harvard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
with victory in sight met every effort, and
stopped it.</p>

<p>Time was flying, and many of the Harvard
people, feeling assured of Harvard's victory,
were filing out of the stands. Yale supporters
stayed on, hoping against hope, for only five
minutes were left to play.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Yale quarter changed his tactics.
Catching the Harvard backs in a favorable position
for the play, he snapped a forward pass
to Armstrong who caught it and made the middle
of the field on a dodging run, where he was
brought down from behind. The gain brought
hope back to drooping Yale spirits, and a cheer
rattled across the field. Immediately on the
heels of this successful pass, which drew out
the Harvard defense, he sent Turner into the
line and added another eight yards. The tide of
Harvard departure was suddenly checked by this
hostile demonstration, and seeing that the defense
did not close up, the heady little quarter
tried Turner again with such effect that it was a
first down.</p>

<p>The Yale stands were cheering like mad, at
this unlooked-for burst of speed when the team
was supposed to be beaten. The captain himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
with Turner clearing the way, lunged forward
five yards and added two more a moment
later. Again the Harvard defense crept in and
the Yale quarter, seeing his opportunity, drove
another forward pass to Armstrong who caught
it cleanly and was off like the wind. He sidestepped
the tackle by the opposing end, ran
obliquely toward the side-line, stopped and let
the rush of tacklers pass him, slipped out of what
seemed an impossible position, and with a clear
field, with the exception of one man, cut straight
for the goal line with friend and foe thundering
behind. Straight at the tackler, who waited with
outstretched arms, he ran. The muscles, which
had been crying for rest a moment before, were
now like steel. Now he was within two steps
of the Harvard back. He appeared to be running
straight to certain disaster, but as the Harvard
tackler lunged forward, Frank swung his
body to one side, brought his forearm down with
all his force on the outstretched arm nearest him,
and was past. The momentary check, however,
brought a fleet Harvard end up to him, who, unwilling
to take a chance at the Yale man's flying
legs, sprang full upon his back. The force carried
Frank off his feet, staggering headlong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Even with the burden on his back he managed to
fall head-first toward the goal line, where he was
instantly pinned to the ground by two tacklers
with such force that he lay stunned.</p>

<p>He required the services of the trainer with
sponge and water bottle before the play could be
resumed. The ball lay exactly ten yards from the
goal and in the face of the known defensive
strength of Harvard, it seemed an impossible
task to put it over from there.</p>

<p>Captain Baldwin took the ball two yards on
the first try and then the red-headed Turner,
like a maddened bull, drove through for four
yards in a whirling mass of red and blue-legged
players. Again Turner was called upon and
when the pile untangled, he had laid the ball
within two yards of the coveted white line which
to cross meant glorious victory.</p>

<p>Captain Baldwin drew his men back for a conference
while the stands stopped their cheering
long enough to speculate whether he would attempt
a goal from the field or risk defeat on an
attempt to carry the ball across for a touchdown.
Doubts were soon set at rest for the
Yale team sprang back into regular formation
and crouched for the signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>You might have heard a pin drop in that vast
crowd, so still they were as the two lines
crouched, with swaying arms and tense bodies.
Snappily came the signal, sounding high, clear
and shrill in that amazing quiet, followed by the
crash of meeting lines. Turner with his head
down between his mighty shoulders, drove like
a catapult into the struggling mass on the heels
of his captain. There was a moment of squirming
and grinding, then the whole mass fell in a
sort of pyramid which refused to untangle itself
even at the orders of the referee, and he was
obliged to pull and dig to get at the bottom.
And what he found at the bottom was Turner,
bruised and bleeding, but joyfully happy with
the ball hugged to his breast and across the goal
line by four inches!</p>

<p>It was of no account that the kick-out (for the
touchdown had been made well toward the corner
of the field) was bungled. Yale had scored
a touchdown and the lead. Two minutes afterward
the whistle ended the game, and the wildest
sort of celebration began. Every member of the
Yale team was seized, protesting, and carried by
the half-crazed students in a whirling march
around the field. Hats were thrown over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
goal posts by the hundreds, the owners entirely
indifferent as to whether they ever got their
headgear back again. Many students went back
to New Haven that night minus their hats, but
little did it matter as Yale had won a glorious
battle in the face of what seemed certain defeat.
And the names of Turner and Armstrong were
on every tongue.</p>

<p>That night Turner was elected captain and
Frank cast his vote for his old friend although
he himself had been nominated as a candidate.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX. <span class="subtit">HOW ALL THINGS CAME OUT AT LAST.</span></h2>

<p>When the spring of Junior year came around,
Frank Armstrong enrolled himself in the baseball
squad. The rest of nearly a year had apparently
completely cured his arm, and he became at
once one of the leading candidates for pitcher.
Coach Quinton had engaged the services of a
professional pitcher from one of the big leagues
for the early practice, and from this man Frank
learned much about the art of pitching. Quinton
was careful, however, not to work him in cold
weather, fearing a return of the trouble in his
pitching arm. The result of this careful handling
was that he rounded into form in mid-season,
and was the mainstay of the nine in the
box. Turner was the receiving end of the battery,
and together they became the terror of opposing
nines.</p>

<p>At the end of a season which was only partly
successful, with a victory from Princeton and a
defeat by Harvard, the latter caused by Yale's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
inability to hit the ball with men on bases, Frank
Armstrong was unanimously elected captain for
Senior year.</p>

<p>"I think the way you two fellows are hogging
the Ys and captaincies around here is disgraceful,"
complained the Codfish one night. "Armstrong
ought to be ashamed. Turner is bad
enough with football and baseball, but Armstrong
is nothing short of a Y trust, with three
different kinds of them. Why aren't you modest
like I am?"</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>"Some are born Ys," paraphrased the Codfish,
"some achieve Ys and some have Ys thrust
upon them."</p>

<p>"You ought to be put out for that," said Frank.
"But I say, how would you like to score for us
next year?"</p>

<p>"To cover up your errors, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, just to keep you quiet."</p>

<p>"In that case, I'm on, but you need look for no
favors in the scoring from me. I'm an impartial
gink. No friends when I'm on the job. Do I get
a southern trip?"</p>

<p>"Sure, you do. But you must keep away from
hired automobiles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forget it," said the Codfish, who didn't like
to be reminded of the Norfolk experience.</p>

<p>Frank and Jimmy spent their summer together
at Seawall, and renewed old acquaintances.
Many hours the two boys spent together going
over plans for their teams, while with swimming
and rowing they kept themselves in the pink of
physical condition.</p>

<p>"My ambition is to win both the Princeton and
Harvard series," Frank said one evening as they
sat on the veranda of the Armstrong cottage,
their eyes wandering over the Bay with its twinkling
lights. "And that's the reason I'm going
to ask you to let me out of football work this
fall."</p>

<p>"I don't like it at all, Frank," returned the
football captain. "I need you. You've had the
experience and I, too, have ambitions."</p>

<p>"Yes, but look at that bunch of Freshman material
from last year's Freshman eleven. It
would make a whole 'Varsity team in itself&mdash;Squires,
Thompson, Williams, Weatherly and
the rest. Great Scott, I wouldn't be in it with
that bunch. You know you don't need me. I've
got a lot of material to whip into shape, and
with both of us out of the nine, Quinton wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
be pleased. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go
out and work with my own team, and if you have
to have me, I'll go over and take my medicine.
But if you don't need me, then I'll keep on with
my own work."</p>

<p>That was the arrangement the captains made
between themselves, and although it was something
of a sacrifice, Captain Turner, fortunately
well supplied with end material, went through
his season with flying colors, ending with two
glorious victories over Yale's dearest foes, and
writing his name, in the doing of it, large on
Yale's page of football history.</p>

<p>When the spring of Senior year rolled around,
it found Frank making progress with the team
he hoped would be called a championship nine.
The Easter trip was an unqualified success, with
only one defeat recorded, and that by the Norfolk
Leaguers. All the college games were won
handily, and the nine returned to New Haven
with a prestige for clever all-around play.</p>

<p>Through the season of preliminary home
games, the nine acquitted itself well. Besides
himself, Captain Armstrong had two pitchers, a
man named Read and of only ordinary ability,
and another, Whittaker, a big, raw-boned westerner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
who was a tower of strength in the box.
On the latter Frank depended as his substitute
in the championship series with Princeton and
Harvard, for the games, owing to a combination
of circumstances, ran so closely together that
no one man could possibly pitch them all.</p>

<p>Four days before the first championship game,
evidence was handed to the captain which made
him doubt the amateur standing of Whittaker.
The testimony was that Whittaker had played
professional ball in a western town. The captain
and coach called the pitcher over to the
former's room for an explanation. The westerner
admitted at once that he had pitched ball
for money for three seasons before coming to
Yale, but since he had used the money to defray
his expenses it was not plain to him that he was
not eligible.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty sorry," said Frank, "but you can't
pitch any more for Yale. In any interpretation
of the rules you are a professional, and not eligible
for an amateur nine."</p>

<p>"Yes, but no one knows it at Princeton or
Harvard, do they?"</p>

<p>"True, but that makes no difference. I say
again, 'I'm mighty sorry but you can't pitch for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Yale,'" and while he said it, his heart sank for
he well knew that Read would never be able to
stem the tide of a championship match, and besides
Read there was no one but himself. To
make matters worse he had recently felt a
twinge in his pitching arm when delivering certain
curves. It might be a recurrence of the
old trouble!</p>

<p>"That about settles us," said Frank after
Whittaker had taken his departure, a sentiment
which was echoed by the college men when it
became known that Whittaker was ineligible.</p>

<p>"We'll pitch Read in the first Princeton game
and take a chance," was Quinton's advice. "It
will be the second game that's the teaser."</p>

<p>Fortune favored Captain Armstrong, for
Princeton very kindly played away off-form, and
allowed Yale to get such a lead in the early
part of the game that even though Read began
to weaken toward the end and was hit hard,
Yale kept her lead without difficulty. Captain
Armstrong played in right field, and was ready
to go in at a moment's notice, but fortunately
there was no need for it. Read, the second string
man, had come through with credit, but the
Princeton batters had given sufficient evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
in the last inning or two what would be likely to
happen to him if he faced them again.</p>

<p>"It seems to be up to you, Captain," said
Quinton, "to clean this up at Princeton next Saturday.
If you do, our chances are better for the
Harvard series, for there will be a little time
for rest. If you don't win, then there has to be
a tie in New York, and that runs us right on
top of the first Harvard game in Cambridge."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking it over," said Frank, "and
you're dead right. That game at Princeton must
be taken, and I'm going to take it if I can. You
put that down in the book."</p>

<p>The college, well knowing the state of the
pitching staff, but with great confidence in the
hard-hitting and fast-fielding team and its captain,
backed it loyally, and sent a thousand men
to Princeton to cheer.</p>

<p>The game was an exciting one from start to
finish, with a great deal of hitting on both sides.
Captain Armstrong, who was in the box, pitched
wonderful ball throughout, and kept hits well
scattered. But it was noticed that he used very
little but a straight ball, his effectiveness being
due to a continual change of pace which baffled
the Princeton batters. Now and then in a critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
moment, he put over a curve, but curves were
the exception.</p>

<p>Coach Quinton watching narrowly from the
bench, knew the significance of the captain's action.
It was the old trouble.</p>

<p>Every man played his position like a veteran
that day, and in spite of the strange ground and
the boundless enthusiasm of the Princeton thousands
back for Commencement celebration,
Frank, before the sun went down, had accomplished
half, at least, of his dearest ambition, a
double championship for Yale, by beating Princeton
with a margin of two runs.</p>

<p>The night before the team left for Cambridge
to play the first game of the Harvard series,
there was a long conference in the captain's room
as to the best way of disposing of Yale's forces.</p>

<p>"I want to pitch Read in that first game," said
Frank. "The chances are against us there anyway,
and it would be better, I think, to let my arm
rest for the second game in New Haven."</p>

<p>"You might start the game," suggested Coach
Quinton, "or be ready to jump in if Read shows
signs of blowing up, but it will depend on how
you feel that day."</p>

<p>"I know how I'll feel," Frank replied, "and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
know how this old wing of mine feels now. I
know that if I pitch in Cambridge, that's the end
of me. I can't throw a ball hard enough now to
break a pane of glass, and I'll be lucky to be able
to stay in the game at all."</p>

<p>Quinton tilted back in the chair and rubbed his
chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Read it will be for the game on
Thursday, and he'll have to go through it,
win or lose," he announced. "You will play in
right field and lob them in if they come in your
direction."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to sit on the bench if you think
Barrows could come through with a hit or two.
He's a better fielder than I am. I want the
strongest nine we can get in there on Thursday,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," said Quinton with determination.
"With one arm you are better than
Barrows with three. He can't hit anything."</p>

<p>And so it was settled that the captain should
play in the field and that Read should go into the
box. It was the best thing to do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>For three innings, Read held the Harvard batters
hitless, and hope began to grow in the team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and in the hearts of the team's supporters that
he would last to the end. Turner's home run
drive with a man on base put Yale in the lead with
two runs, in the second inning. But in the fourth,
Read, in trying to get a ball over the inside corner
of the plate, hit a batter, and in the endeavor to
retrieve his error by catching the man napping
off first base, threw wild to the first baseman.
The result was that before the ball was recovered
the runner was perched, grinning, on third base.</p>

<p>The double error unsteadied Read, who in his
endeavor to strike out the next two batters who
were both good waiters, passed them both. The
bases were filled with none out. Then came Harvard's
hard-hitting catcher with a three-base hit
which drove in three runs. That ended Read's
efficiency. In the same inning he was hit for a
single and two doubles in succession. The net
result of this slaughter, coupled with a base on
balls and two infield errors, gave Harvard six
runs before the side was retired.</p>

<p>Yale added a run in the fifth, but Harvard,
now hitting like demons, and with Read at their
mercy, slammed the ball for three more runs.
Yale continued to play with dogged determination
against overpowering odds, striving to hold down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the score as low as it might be. The fielders
worked faithfully, but Read was now being hit at
will and many of the balls went safely.</p>

<p>"Let me go in and try to stop this," Frank suggested,
as he came to the bench in the eighth inning.</p>

<p>"No use now," said Quinton. "It's Harvard's
day and the game is gone. Stay where you are
and we'll take this back again next Tuesday."</p>

<p>In the eighth and ninth, Read steadied down,
but then it was too late, in spite of a dogged up-hill
fight by Yale. The final score stood 14 to 5.</p>

<p>Read had no appetite that night at the training
table.</p>

<p>"Never mind it, old fellow," said Frank, laying
his hand on Read's shoulder. "That happens to
the best of them once in a while; forget it; we'll
get them next Tuesday. They had all the breaks
of luck, anyway. It was their day."</p>

<p>"Yes, they had me; I was the best man on they
had; I'm disgusted with myself," and the big
pitcher hung his head.</p>

<p>"Forget it," said Frank, and nothing more was
said; but in spite of the assumed cheerfulness it
was a quiet lot of ball-players who took the train
for New Haven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next four days, the captain's arm
was a subject for the careful attention of the
trainers, who rubbed and kneaded the strained
member at every possible opportunity. Nearly
every known remedy was tried, for well everyone
knew that on Armstrong depended the next game&mdash;the
great Commencement game&mdash;which drew
back thousands of graduates. The worried coach
spent most of his time with Captain Armstrong,
and when he had exhausted his own knowledge
of arm treatments, went to old Yale ball-players
who were flocking back to give what assistance
they could in the crucial game. The newspapers
deprecated Yale's chances, but the college was
behind its team to a man.</p>

<p>"Armstrong has a glass arm," wrote the sporting
writers in the daily prints. "Little hope for
the Bull-dog; Harvard expects to clean up on
Tuesday."</p>

<p>"We may fool 'em yet," said Frank, as he
threw down a paper he had been reading, "eh,
Turner? This old wing feels better to-night
and I'm dying to get a chance at them."</p>

<p>"And we are with you," said Turner. "I want
to get away from the memory of the fourteen to
five business up at Cambridge."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>The great day came. Although the game was
not called till three o'clock, the big wooden stands
at the Field were filled an hour before that time.
The spectators had gathered early to watch the
antics of the returning uniformed classes of
graduates, whose parade behind a score of bands
is always one of the features of the day.</p>

<p>Joyfully the long line of the parade wound
around the field, the younger graduates capering
to the ringing music of the bands, the older ones
more sedate and garbed more soberly. Gradually
the classes were ushered to their seats and half an
hour before the game the grounds were cleared.</p>

<p>Harvard had a fast and snappy practice.
When Armstrong led his men on to the diamond
for the Yale practice, the cheer-leaders led the
packed thousands in a tremendous ovation.</p>

<p>"They seem to be with us, anyway," said
Frank, who was standing with Coach Quinton
by the home plate.</p>

<p>"You can bet everything you own, they are,"
returned Quinton, "and we must give them what
they are looking for&mdash;a victory."</p>

<p>"I'd give my arm to do it," said Frank. And
he meant it.</p>

<p>All the preliminaries over, there was a hush as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the captains at the plate with the two umpires
talked over ground rules. It was Harvard first
to bat, and as the Yale team trotted to their positions
in the field and the captain took up his place
in the box, a roar swept the stands, while the
cheer-leaders bawled through their megaphones:
"Make more noise, you fellows, we can't hear
you."</p>

<p>That was a game long to be remembered. The
very first of the red-stockinged batters met
squarely the first ball Captain Armstrong delivered,
and drove it between left and center for
three bases.</p>

<p>"Same old story," sang out the Harvard cheer-leader.
"Give them a cheer; we'll make a dozen
the first inning."</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. The next two batters,
the strongest of the team, fell before Frank's
shoots, and the third put up a foul fly which
Turner captured close to the stand. This gave
the Yale men a chance to let loose some enthusiasm.</p>

<p>In Yale's half of the inning, a single and an
error put two men on bases with one out. But
the necessary hits were not forthcoming, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the men reached third and second, the side
was retired before a runner crossed the plate.</p>

<p>Nip and tuck, the teams played for five innings
with no runs scored on either side. Armstrong
was pitching brilliant ball. No one in the stands
and but few on the team itself, knew the price he
was paying. Slow and fast he mixed them up,
with an occasional curve which sent twinges of
pain from finger tips to shoulder. In tight places,
he steadied his team and was always the Captain,
inspiring and resourceful.</p>

<p>Coach Quinton well knew what Frank was going
through. "Can you stick it out?" he said,
when the game was more than half over.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm pitching and praying at
the same time," was the answer.</p>

<p>The break came in the sixth, and it was in
Harvard's favor. With one out, Kingston, the
big Harvard first baseman, hit a liner to the
pitcher's box, which Frank partly blocked with
his gloved hand. The ball bounded to the left
and fell dead twenty feet behind him, and before
the second baseman, who had come in with all
possible speed, could field it, Kingston had
crossed first base. The next man up singled over
second. With two on, Captain Armstrong tightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
up and struck out the following batter,
while the stands roared their approval; but the
next man hit a low liner to left field, which scored
Kingston. Frank was pitching now slowly and
deliberately. His arm was numb, but somehow
he got over the third strike on the last man and
saved more runs.</p>

<p>Yale fought hard to win the run back and got
a man to third, but a stinging liner to short-stop
was perfectly handled and the side was out.
Nothing happened in the eighth for either side,
and Harvard began the ninth, one run to the
good, steady and confident.</p>

<p>Armstrong was pitching now on nerve alone.
His arm, subjected to a hard strain through the
preceding eight innings, was what the newspapers
had called "glass," but the brain that directed it
was cool and calculating. Fortunately for him,
the first man fouled out to the third baseman on
the second ball pitched, but the second batter
caught one of the Yale pitcher's slow lobs and
made a safe hit. The third bunted down the
third base line and was also safe. It was now
or never, and gathering up his fast waning forces,
Frank struck out the next man, while the shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
pains in his arm brought the cold sweat out
on his forehead.</p>

<p>Confidently the last Harvard batter faced him,
swinging his bat. Frank tried a curve which
went outside the plate. A foul followed, and
then a strike. Twice he threw high to tease the
batter, and then with all the vigor he had left, he
snapped over a straight ball, close to the knees.
The batter swiped desperately at it.</p>

<p>"You're out," came the sharp tones of the umpire;
and as the batter threw his bat wickedly
towards the bench, the Yale stands rose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>
and yelled their approval.</p>

<p>"We've got to win it now," commanded Captain
Armstrong at the bench. "It's our last
chance. I can't pitch another ball."</p>

<p>At that command the team galvanized into
action. The first man up bunted the ball of the
hitherto invincible pitcher down the first base
line, and was safe. Then came the reliable Turner,
gritting his teeth and pawing the ground at
the plate. Twice he let the ball pass on strikes,
and then the Harvard man pitched one to his
liking&mdash;a swift, straight ball at about the shoulder.
Turner met it with all the force of his
vigorous young body, well towards the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
bat, full and square. The ball started low, like a
well-hit golf ball from the tee, rising as it traveled.
Out and up it went, while the runner on
first, after one look, scudded for home.</p>

<p>Just what became of that ball, no one ever
knew. It was never found. Some say it struck
an automobile on the far side of the outfield fence,
and some even say it continued its flight on down
to the river. But it did not matter. It was a
clean home-run, Turner following his galloping
teammate more leisurely, trotting across the plate
with the winning run.</p>

<p>Down from the stands poured the thousands.
They dashed on the field and swept up Captain
Armstrong and his gallant warriors. Then when
the first transports of joy were over, the classes
broke into the zigzag step, arms on shoulders, to
the crash of a score of bands. And no one
thought the outburst extravagant, for Yale had
won.</p>

<p>Four days later, after almost superhuman efforts
to improve Captain Armstrong's arm, Yale
again met Harvard on neutral grounds and again
won, thus clinching the championship.</p>

<p>Thus was Frank Armstrong's hope of a double
championship realized. His name is still pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to by admiring aspirants for pitching honors in
the old college, and his skill and pluck are part
of the traditions of baseball.</p>

<p>There is little left to tell of our story. The day
after Captain Armstrong's great baseball victory
at New Haven he joined in the imposing exercises
of Commencement day. With others of the
Senior class, he marched in solemn academic procession
through the historic Campus and city
common, and later took his degree from the
hands of the President of the college on the broad
platform of Woolsey Hall, crowded with black-robed
dignitaries.</p>

<p>Undergraduate life was a thing of the past,
and as our three friends walked slowly back to
their room to begin packing for their departure,
there was little joy in their bearing. Even the
irrepressible Codfish was temporarily subdued.</p>

<p>"Well, was it worth it, eh, Frank?" said Turner
as he began throwing things into his trunk.</p>

<p>"Was it worth it? Why, Jimmy, it is worth
half a man's life to be here four years."</p>

<p>"My sentiments, too," broke in the Codfish.</p>

<p>"And mine," said a deep voice at the door. It
was David Powers, one of the big forces in the
undergraduate world, who had won his way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
prominence in literary work while his friends
were climbing athletic heights.</p>

<p>"Let's pledge ourselves, then, to old Yale," said
Frank, and the four boys grasped hands.</p>

<p>"We may never meet like this again, fellows,
but let us not forget that wonderful old line&mdash;&mdash;</p>
